0,maureen,dowd,292,article,"I found myself sitting on a bar stool last winter next to Robert Caro at an Irish wake in Times Square for my irreplaceable Times colleague Frank Prial. I had an overpowering urge to grab Caro’s arm and shake him. For the love of Pete, I wanted to yelp at the 78-year-old historian who has spent 38 years chronicling Lyndon Johnson in more than 3,388 pages, was he ever going to get to Vietnam? But the shy, bespectacled writer picking at his hors d’oeuvres did not look like the sort of man who could be rushed. As Adam Nagourney wrote in The Times on Sunday, Luci Baines Johnson and other members of L.B.J.’s shrinking circle are pushing to broaden the lens on the president’s legacy so that it is not merely viewed “through the prism of a failed war.” They are using the 50th anniversary of Johnson’s more impressive domestic policies — including the Civil Rights Act, the Clean Air Act and Medicare — to yank the focus away from “the agony of Vietnam” and “his cross,” as his daughter calls it. “Nobody wanted that war less than Lyndon Johnson,” the 66-year-old Luci said, adding that he tried mightily to get out. Maybe ratcheting up the war with more than 500,000 troops and sending so many young Americans to their deaths halfway around the world based on chest-thumping advice and a naïve theory of democratic dominoes was a deterrent to getting out. In the new Broadway play with Bryan Cranston as L.B.J., “All The Way,” by Robert Schenkkan, there’s a scene where Robert McNamara pushes Johnson to order “retaliatory” airstrikes after the Potemkin Gulf of Tonkin. Hubert Humphrey tries to slow them down, noting that they should not strike back “for an attack which may or may not have happened,” but Johnson, prodded by McNamara, frets about how Barry Goldwater would slam him if he went “soft on the military.” Johnson was determined not to be seen as weak, not to “cut and run” — the same phrase later used by W. about Iraq when he was determined not to be seen as a wimp and began sending so many young Americans to their deaths halfway around the world based on chest-thumping advice and a naïve theory of democratic dominoes. Asked by a reporter about Iraq recently, W.’s eyes flashed and he replied, “I am not happy.” He shouldn’t be. Afghanistan, which he abandoned to pursue a phony “retaliatory” war in Iraq, is crumbling despite all the money, muscle and blood we have poured into it, with our runaway fruitcake puppet Hamid Karzai fiddling while the Taliban burns, vowing to run America out just as they did the Russians and waging vicious attacks on women. In corrupt and violent Iraq, women are getting detained illegally and tortured. The country is awash in a blood-dimmed tide, with nearly 9,000 killed last year and almost 1,000 killed last month, as Al Qaeda and another jihadist group fight for supremacy. In Falluja, the city where nearly 100 American soldiers died in the fiercest fighting of the war, the black insurgent flag now flies over buildings. With the help of his own personal librarian, Laura, W. has been trying to reframe his legacy to take the focus off his botched wars, just like L.B.J.’s family. His presidential library highlights his work on AIDS in Africa, belatedly tapering the roles of his sulfurous regents, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. With Laura at his side, W. spent a long time chatting with reporters on the way to Nelson Mandela’s funeral, putting his own spin on his presidency. The Texan who hated being “put on the couch,” as he called it, said he had a strategy to see into Vladimir Putin’s soul that entailed getting his attention by asking him, at their first meeting, about something he had read, that his mother had a cross that was blessed in Jerusalem. The Russian leader told him the breakup of the Soviet Union was the worst thing that had ever happened. Tell it to Ukraine, W. dryly noted. He also said of Putin: “You always have to watch out when someone steeples their fingers.” Just as L.B.J. observed that the two things that make politicians more stupid than anything else are sex and envy, W. said that he was not surprised by how Putin evolved because the three things that can change someone are “a love of power, wealth and sex.” He said that since his heart surgery, he was spending a lot of time painting skulls. Animal skulls, Laura quickly interjected. He continued his campaign to downplay the influence of Cheney, stressing that he had “lots of advisers.” Asked how much he sees Cheney, he said “never” and asserted that he had never been that close to his vice president and the age difference precluded a friendship. So he let an acquaintance ruin his presidency? But just as L.B.J. will always be yoked to Vietnam and McNamara, 43 will always be yoked to his careless misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan and to Cheney. W. should know: Some landscapes cannot be painted over.",415,500,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/dowd-history-get-me-rewrite.html,2014-02-19,History: Get Me Rewrite!
0,,,119,article,"In November, when the Internal Revenue Service finally stirred itself to propose a modest crackdown on the abuse of the tax code by political groups, it was immediately attacked by tax-exempt nonprofit groups on the right. That wasn’t too surprising; secret donations from conservatives to these groups are the principal reason American politics is now dominated by those with huge bank accounts. But now liberal tax-exempt groups are also raising their voice in protest over the I.R.S.’s plans, afraid that they will be caught in the same crackdown, and will be unable to engage in political activity. The best thing the I.R.S. can do is to ignore both sides and proceed swiftly ahead, making its proposed rules even stronger to squeeze the influence of money out of politics. The problem of secret money began in 2010, with the loosening of rules that was prompted in part by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. Political operatives like Karl Rove realized that “social welfare” groups were allowed by the tax code to accept unlimited donations that did not have to be disclosed. They could then use that money to run political attack ads. Though the tax code says the groups, known as 501(c)(4)s, could not be engaged primarily in political activity and still keep their tax exemption, that was easy enough to get around by claiming the ads had some kind of civic purpose. By the 2012 election, these groups were spending $300 million and were often the dominant voice in major races. The Koch brothers, in particular, got around the tax code provision by moving tens of millions among a huge number of nonprofits so that it was almost impossible to determine the purpose of each group, let alone who the donors were. After looking the other way for years, the I.R.S. in November proposed excluding “candidate-related political activity” from the definition of social welfare. That includes ads advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, or any ads that mention a candidate near an election. It also would exclude activities like voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, along with voter guides, unless they meet a strict nonpartisan test. House Republicans, hoping to keep the cash flowing, quickly prepared a bill to prevent the rules from taking effect. (They’re still claiming that I.R.S. scrutiny of nonprofit groups was politically directed at them, despite evidence to the contrary.) But liberal groups, like the Alliance for Justice, also filed protests with the I.R.S., saying the restrictions were too broad and could prevent activities like candidate scorecards, which many issue groups distribute before an election. Those arguments are weak. Any group that wants to engage in political activity or issue scorecards can easily continue doing so by organizing a group under the tax code’s Section 527, which provides for political organizations. The only difference is that those groups, which are also tax exempt, have to disclose their donors. Groups that want to play in the political arena should be open about the source of their funds. If anything, the I.R.S. rules, which should be sped up to have some effect on the November elections, ought to be stronger. The same prohibitions against political activity should also apply to business leagues like chambers of commerce, and to unions, both of which are organized under different sections of the tax code that allow concealment of donors. The rules should be far more explicit that no amount of political activity is acceptable for any group that refuses to disclose contributors. Secret money has become the scourge of the political system and needs to be eliminated regardless of the inconvenience to nonprofit groups, whatever their ideology. Republicans have blocked Congress from dealing with the problem, so now it is up to the I.R.S. to do its job.",554,546,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/change-the-rules-on-secret-money.html,2014-02-19,Change the Rules on Secret Money
0,,,14,article,"With the apparent collapse of the United Nations-mediated peace talks on Syria, the United States and its allies find themselves in a difficult spot. Absent a diplomatic and political option, what can the world do about a civil war that has killed an estimated 136,000 people, produced nine million refugees, displaced 4.25 million civilians internally and now threatens to destabilize several other countries in the region? Mr. Obama has to be frustrated over the failure of the talks; a second and largely fruitless round ended last week in Geneva. Having said, rightly, that there is no military solution, he has struggled to get the negotiations off the ground. The opposition forces, though weak, at least proposed a transitional government. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria not only resisted any compromise but actually intensified the bombing of rebel neighborhoods; 5,000 more people have reportedly been killed. American officials say that Mr. Assad’s grip has grown stronger over the past year, thanks largely to the reliable support of his patrons in Russia and Iran. Yet despite Secretary of State John Kerry’s criticism, Moscow has enabled Mr. Assad to “double down,” while the rest of the world has largely given Iran and Russia a pass. That is astonishing. Experts say Syria is using Russian-supplied helicopters to attack in Homs, and Russia most likely has supplied engines, transmissions and other spare parts. Iran has also been shipping arms and deploying its elite Quds Force paramilitary units to assist Mr. Assad, as well as encouraging Hezbollah militants to fight on his behalf. Now that peace talks have run aground, Mr. Obama has asked his advisers to review old and new options for bolstering opposition forces and easing the desperate humanitarian crisis. These tasks have grown even more complicated as Syria has increasingly become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists and as ever-larger refugee flows threaten to destabilize the region. Such threats may at some point require bolder steps. But, so far, no one has come up with surefire remedies or even new ideas that would not draw the United States into war. Options under consideration include providing money, transportation and intelligence to some rebel fighters. But such moves are unlikely to change the military balance. The administration is reportedly not considering strategies that have already been rejected, such as airstrikes or directly supplying the rebels with weapons beyond the limited arms and training available to them under a program led by the Central Intelligence Agency. It is unclear whether the administration has dropped its objections to Saudi Arabia supplying vetted rebel groups with more advanced weapons. Mr. Obama has resisted being pushed into a war by critics who seem to believe that force is the ultimate sign of leadership. Leadership sometimes means not going to war. It also means, in this case, persisting in the frustrating search for a peaceful solution and, short of that, some means of lessening the misery of the Syrian people.",47,61,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/what-next-for-syria.html,2014-02-19,What Next for Syria?
0,,,756,article,"One of the biggest obstacles to reducing America’s enormous prison population is the stubbornly high rates of recidivism. Nationwide, as many as half of those released end up back in prison within three years. There are many reasons for this, and not many simple answers, but one solution has long proved to be both reliable and cost-effective: education behind bars. People who go to prison are already among the least educated members of society. While about 20 percent of the general public doesn’t have a high school diploma, that number rises to nearly 40 percent among prisoners. Yet the same political and social forces that have driven the country’s prison boom over four decades have also worked to eliminate most government support for inmate education, including Congress’s irrational and counterproductive decision in 1994 to deny federal Pell grants to people in prison. In the aftermath, the number of college degree programs for prisoners around the country dropped from 350 to about a dozen. On Sunday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York took a bold step to restore some common sense to this contorted debate, announcing new financing for college classes in 10 state prisons. The initiative will offer inmates the opportunity to earn either an associate’s or a bachelor’s degree over the course of two to three years. Mr. Cuomo was quick to point out that the cost — $5,000 per inmate per year — is a fraction of the $60,000 New York spends annually to house a prisoner. But even more compelling is the weight of decades of data: According to a RAND study released last summer reviewing 30 years of research, inmates who participated in educational programs had a substantially reduced risk of reoffending within three years than those who did not. That’s partly because of higher rates of post-release employment for those who got an education while in prison. A job means more stability and more money — which translates into less crime, fewer inmates, and more savings for taxpayers. Every dollar spent on inmate education, the study calculated, meant $4 to $5 not spent on reincarceration down the road. For the past two decades, prisoner education money has been scrounged up by private groups working to fill in the gaps left by the government. The Vera Institute of Justice recently received financing for a five-year project to educate prisoners in Michigan, New Jersey and North Carolina. And, in New York, the Bard Prison Initiative, directed by Bard College, has enrolled more than 500 students since 2001 and handed out more than 250 college degrees. While the state struggles with an overall recidivism rate of 40 percent, only 4 percent of prisoners enrolled in the Bard program and 2.5 percent of those who completed a degree returned to prison. Results like these would seem hard to dispute, but several Republican legislators are opposing Mr. Cuomo’s plan, calling it a “slap in the face” to law-abiding New Yorkers. This argument makes no more sense than it did in 1994, when less than 1 percent of all Pell grants went to prisoners. In both cases, education isn’t an either-or proposition. More than 700,000 inmates walk out of state and federal prisons across the country every year, and it is in everyone’s interest to make sure they stay out.",1538,647,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/gov-cuomos-bold-step-on-prison-education.html,2014-02-19,Gov.

0,thomas,friedman,406,article,"Beginning March 2, Prof. Hossam Haick, will teach the first ever massive open online course, or MOOC, on nanotechnology in Arabic. What’s more interesting, though, he explained to me the other day over breakfast is some of the curious email he’s received from students registering for his MOOC from all over the Arab world. Their questions include: Are you a real person? Are you really an Arab, or are you an Israeli Jew speaking Arabic, pretending to be an Arab? That’s because Haick is an Israeli Arab from Nazareth and will be teaching this course from his home university, the Technion, Israel’s premier science and technology institute, and the place we were having breakfast was Tel Aviv. His course is entitled Nanotechnology and Nanosensors and is designed for anyone interested in learning about Haick’s specialty: “novel sensing tools that make use of nanotechnology to screen, detect, and monitor various events in either our personal or professional life.” The course includes 10 classes of 3 to 4 short lecture videos — in Arabic and English — and anyone with an Internet connection can tune in and participate for free in the weekly quizzes, forum activities and do a final project. If you had any doubts about the hunger for education in the Middle East today, Haick’s MOOC will dispel them. So far, there are about 4,800 registrations for the Arabic version, including students from Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and the West Bank. Iranians are signing up for the English version. Because the registration is through the Coursera MOOC website, some registrants initially don’t realize the course is being taught by an Israeli Arab scientist at the Technion, said Haick, and when they do, some professors and students “unregister.” But most others are sticking with it. (MOOC’s have just started to emerge in the Arab world via Coursera, edX, Edraak, Rwaq, SkillAcademy and MenaVersity — some with original content, much still translated.) Asked why he thought the course was attracting so much interest in the neighborhood, Haick said: “Because nanotechnology and nanosensors are perceived as futuristic, and people are curious to understand what the future looks like.” And because nanotechnology “is so cross- and multi-disciplinary. ... It offers a large diversity of research opportunities.” Haick, 38, whose Ph.D. is from the Technion, where his father also graduated, is a science prodigy. He and the Technion already have a start-up together, developing what he calls “an electronic nose” — a sensory array that mimics the way a dog’s nose works to detect what Haick and his team have proved to be unique markers in exhaled breath that reveal different cancers in the body. In between that and teaching chemical engineering, the Technion’s president, Peretz Lavie, suggested that Haick lead the school into the land of MOOCs. Lavie, Haick explained, “thinks there is a high need to bring science beyond the boundaries between countries. He told me there is something called a ‘MOOC.’ I did not know what is a MOOC. He said it is a course that can be given to thousands of people over the Web. And he asked if I can give the first MOOC from the Technion — in Arabic.” The Technion is funding the project, which took nine months to prepare, and Haick is donating the lectures. Some 19 percent of the Technion’s students today are Israeli Arabs, up from 9 percent 12 years ago. Haick says he always tells people, “If the Middle East was like the Technion, we would already have peace. In the pure academy, you feel totally equal with every person. And you are appreciated based on your excellence.” He adds without meaning to boast, “I have young people who tell me from the Arab world: ‘You have become our role model. Please let us know the ingredients of how we become like you.’ ” I know what some readers are thinking: nice bit of Israeli propaganda, now could you please go back to writing about Israel’s ugly West Bank occupation. No. This story is a useful reminder that Israel is a country, not just a conflict, and, as a country, it’s still a work in progress. It has its lows, like the occupation and economic discrimination against Israeli Arabs, and its highs, like the collaboration between Haick and the Technion, which is providing a tool for those in the Arabic-speaking world eager to grasp the new technologies reshaping the global economy. Those, like members of the B.D.S. — boycott, divestiture, sanctions — movement who treat Israel as if it is only the sum of how it deals with the West Bank and therefore deserves to be delegitimized as a state, would do well to reflect on some of these complexities. For me, though, Haick’s MOOC is also a reminder of what an utter waste of money and human talent has been the Arab-Israeli conflict. Look how eager all these young Arabs and Persians are for the tools and resources to realize their full potential, wherever they can find that learning. Arab dictators so underestimated their people for so long. That’s what fueled the Arab awakening. It makes you weep for the wasted generations and pray this will be the last of them.",1398,906,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/friedman-breakfast-before-the-mooc.html,2014-02-19,Breakfast Before the MOOC
0,srecko,horvat,198,article,"SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina — A BOY, his voice heavy with embarrassment and regret, was performing Samuel Beckett in Serbo-Croatian. “Mr. Godot,” he said, “told me to tell you that he won’t come this evening, but surely tomorrow.” It was 1993 in Sarajevo. Outside, the only sounds came from a United Nations vehicle rolling by and, in the distance, a mortar shell exploding. The staging of the play, “Waiting for Godot,” was managed by Susan Sontag, and her choice was apt: Despite the United Nations presence, the war-torn country felt as if it was waiting for a resolution that would never arrive. Almost 20 years later, Bosnia and Herzegovina is once more torn by strife, but this time it is different. Frustrated with corruption, political inaction, unpaid wages and youth unemployment around 60 percent, workers started a protest in the northern town of Tuzla on Feb. 4. Within days, the unrest had spread nationwide. By the time I arrived in Sarajevo a week later, scores of government buildings had been set on fire. Around the country, protesters are not just occupying streets and public squares but organizing plenums to create alternative governments. In Sarajevo, one such assembly was taking place at the youth center, which before the wars of the 1990s was one of the most popular Western-style clubs in Yugoslavia. During the war it was hit by artillery shells and caught fire. Now I watched as more than 1,000 people — mothers without a job, former soldiers, professors, students, desperate unpaid workers — gathered here to discuss the future of the country. In the best tradition of direct democracy, after hours of discussion, the participants agreed to set up a completely new government, to curtail the salaries and benefits of politicians, and rein in the privatization process, which many in this country consider hopelessly corrupt. The same day, the plenum in Tuzla forced the local government to fulfill one of its demands: eliminating the practice of paying “white bread,” or salaries of politicians after they leave office — savings of some $700,000 a year, enough to cover about 130 average annual pensions. Aside from these small but important victories, the people’s assemblies have succeeded in what the international community and the awkward, tripartite government it imposed failed to do over the last 20 years — namely, overcoming the rifts among the country’s Croats, Serbs and Bosnians that have haunted it since the end of the war. During the first day of protests in Sarajevo, one young man, among 50 others, had been pushed into the river by the police. A few days later, I watched as he appeared with a broken leg in front of the plenum. “I am a Catholic, I am a Jew, I am a Muslim, I am all the citizens of this country,” he said. Another man added: “If I am a Muslim, and he is a Serb or a Croat, if we are hungry, aren’t we brothers? We are at least brothers-in-stomach.” Then he muttered, “I am not smart, but I just wanted to say this.” From the other corner of the fully packed hall, someone replied: “If you’re here, you’re smart!” As Andrej Nikolaidis, a Sarajevo-born writer who escaped the city while it was under siege by Serbian forces in the early 1990s, said, “The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are these days greater Europeans than the Europeans themselves, they are now the ones who are serious about European ideals, while the E.U. created a museum of abandoned ideals.” These plenums are attracting ever more people and are now part of the daily routine. During the day people protest in the streets, and afterward they gather in the assemblies. Instead of waiting for Godot — for Ms. Sontag, it was the “international community” that was supposed to stop the war; today it is the European Union, which is supposed to bring an end to economic despair — they have taken the future into their own hands. But unlike the 1990s, when international action was the only solution, today the people are uninterested in European Union intervention. When Valentin Inzko, the union’s high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, said the unrest might require international troops to quell it, protesters lashed out at him, too. Of course, the cynics among us could pose the legitimate question: What happened after the Arab Spring? What happened after Occupy Wall Street? And the answer might sound disappointing for anyone hoping to see something come of these new protests: In Egypt, we had first a stronger Muslim Brotherhood, and then military rule again; in the United States we find the same financial system again. So why would Bosnia and Herzegovina be different? But this time, protesters are up against not a military dictatorship or a financial hegemon, but an ill-conceived, poorly run government that few people, in or out of it, believe in. And it would be wrong to say that the protesters are new to this game. The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been struggling, in one way or another, for decades to construct a better country for themselves. In that sense, the best answer we might give, for now, also comes from Samuel Beckett: Try again, fail again, fail better.",763,555,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/godot-arrives-in-sarajevo.html,2014-02-19,Godot Arrives in Sarajevo
0,witold,rybczynski,167,article,"PHILADELPHIA — Although President Obama has nearly three years left in his second term, plans for his presidential library are starting to take shape. On Jan. 31 came the announcement that the Barack H. Obama Foundation had been formed to “manage the library planning process.” Chicago, where Mr. Obama made his home and built his political career, seems the likeliest site, but people in Honolulu, where he was born, and New York, where he finished college (at Columbia) and where he is believed to want to live after he leaves the White House, are making the case for their cities. There is speculation in the architectural press that the British architect David Adjaye, who is designing the National Museum of African-American History and Culture on the Mall in Washington, has the inside track for the commission. But where the library is situated or who designs it is less important than whether Mr. Obama will follow the grandiose example of his predecessors, or chart a new course. A presidential library is an archive, museum and shrine, rolled into one. The archive preserves presidential papers (which are the property of the government) for the benefit of future scholars. The museum contains educational exhibits. The shrine is represented by displays of personal mementos: the Bible on which Harry S. Truman took his oath of office, the extra-long sofa from Lyndon B. Johnson’s Senate office, Gerald R. Ford’s college football trophies. A centerpiece of the Kennedy Library, on Boston Harbor, is his sailboat, the Victura. The Eisenhower and Nixon libraries include the presidents’ boyhood homes. The sprawling Reagan Library houses the largest of all presidential artifacts: Air Force One. Presidential archives have grown immense, encompassing emails, videos, photographs and vast stores of digital data, as well as letters and memorandums. Less predictably, the museums are growing too. The galleries of the Reagan Library, for example, are more than four times larger than those of the Eisenhower Library, though both presidents served two terms, and Ike’s was hardly less momentous. The design of a modern presidential library thus leaves its architect in something of a quandary. A presidential library is a very big building, but does that mean that it should also be monumental? And if it is not a monument, or a memorial, what should it look like? I.M. Pei created a soaring atrium for the Kennedy Library that somewhat overwhelms its subject; Gordon Bunshaft, obliged to safeguard the archives from flooding, created a 10-story travertine bunker for the Johnson Library that appears simply too imperial; for the Clinton Library, James Stewart Polshek designed a hovering steel-and-glass box that says more about the architecture than the presidency. The George W. Bush Library steers a middle course, breaking down the scale and using unpretentious brick rather than marble, but it’s still very large (full disclosure: I was a member of the design committee for the library). The first presidential library was built in 1939-40 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, next to his family home in Hyde Park, N.Y. (The library was Roosevelt’s idea; previous presidents had kept their papers private or donated them to the Library of Congress.) He called it a “library” because it sounded less forbidding than “archive,” and from the beginning his library had a public role, exhibiting not only documents but also artifacts like model ships, rare books and art commissioned through the Works Progress Administration. The library does not replicate the Oval Office (that was Truman’s idea), though it displays his crowded desk as it looked when Roosevelt died. Roosevelt was an amateur architect, and he admired classicism; he championed the Jefferson Memorial, and even hired its builder for his library. But the design, based on the president’s own sketches, is not a classical temple. Roosevelt must have realized that a sitting president engaging in self-commemoration might appear ostentatious, and he purposefully made the library un-monumental. The one-story Dutch Revival structure — fieldstone walls, small windows and a steep slate roof — is larger than a house, but the U-shaped building, with its courtyard and deep front porch, has a definite domestic air. Rather than a memorial, Roosevelt conceived of his library as a Big House. This compelling image has not been improved upon. Although the original displays included such arcane objects as Roosevelt’s christening gown, there was no attempt to tell the entire story of his presidency, the New Deal or his role in the Second World War. Modern presidential libraries, on the other hand, want to describe everything. Yet there is something futile about trying to encapsulate a president’s life and accomplishments in a single building. Our knowledge about (and changing assessment of) any president are shaped by many sources: not only memoirs, biographies and declassified papers but also movies and even television docudramas. Exhibition designers are awfully good at interactive displays, but the world (and historians) will have the final say. There are reports that Mr. Obama used to be skeptical of having a library at all; a bold move would be to deposit his papers at the central National Archives and forgo a library. (The National Archives and Records Administration manages the 13 presidential libraries, which are built with private funds. The Herbert C. Hoover Library opened in 1962.) Failing that, he should set himself apart by thinking small or, at least, smaller. Mr. Obama has written a moving book about his early life; there’s no need to retell that story. His library should be more of an archive and less of a museum, more of a house, less of a shrine. In an austere age, a modest library could be the grandest statement of all.  Witold Rybczynski,  a professor emeritus of urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, is the author, most recently, of “How Architecture Works: A Humanist’s Toolkit.” ",313,243,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/obama-and-his-library-go-small.html,2014-02-19,Obama and His Library: Go Small
0,sarah,ashoor,68,article,"Ever since it gained independence from Britain in 1971, Bahrain has diligently sought to build a modern state. But the fallout from Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979 made this effort much more difficult, fueling theocratic movements like the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain and Hezbollah in the Arabian Peninsula. The transnational expansion of Iran’s propaganda into the Shiite populations of the neighboring Arab states has helped split the region along sectarian lines, mobilized militant movements and complicated reform in several nations. Nowhere has this been more evident than in Bahrain. Official Iranian claims to the islands have only grown more flagrant since the Iranian revolution. A small kingdom of major strategic importance, Bahrain serves as a base for the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet and is a firm advocate for the Saudi-backed Gulf Union. It has a historically complex demographic makeup of Shiites, Sunnis and minority Christian and Jewish communities. Over the years, Bahrain has faced an analogous cycle of events: The state pursues political and economic reforms. These efforts are then hijacked by unpopular radical Shiite Islamists supported by Iran. Eventually, the state overcomes these challenges and restores stability — sometimes at the cost of initially pursued reform efforts. This pattern has been recurring since the state was founded and has again resurfaced in the three years since the latest Shiite-led Bahraini revolt, which mimicked uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other Arab nations. What started as a legitimate populist movement in Bahrain was soon co-opted by coalitions of young anarchists and so-called human rights activists that are completely beholden to the aging ayatollahs in Bahrain and Iran and are more interested in sectarian religious dominance than humanistic progress. For nearly 50 years, significant strides toward development and reform have been consistently derailed. From the Shirazi and Sadr Shiite revolutionary movements of the 1960s and 70s to the formation of the Iranian-funded militant group, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, these movements have all professed deep sectarian ideologies. This mind-set helped propel the Shiite jihadi Sheikh Abdul-Amir al-Jamri to prominence in the 1990s by advocating an extreme, perverted Shiite political program based on the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s writings to wage a holy war on Bahrain’s monarchy. In 2001, King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa promulgated the National Action Charter, launching the process of institutionalizing democracy in Bahrain by promising a new era that would establish a progressive political system and more representative governance. It was hoped that these genuine strides toward reform would prompt radicals to moderate their views, return from exile and participate in reform efforts. But, in the absence of alternative moderate political parties, the radical, Iranian-financed theocratic agenda has become entrenched in domestic Bahraini politics. The Wefaq Shiite party, the Shiite Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs and other sectarian blocs have dominated the nation’s political arena, nearly monopolizing ballots and votes. Not only have these extremists failed to understand and represent their constituencies, their theocratic agenda remains incapable of addressing voters’ genuine economic and social grievances. This was particularly evident in 2004, when the Wefaq party succumbed to a fatwa by Ayatollah Isa Qassim, Bahrain’s most revered Shiite cleric and the party’s spiritual leader. The fatwa denied Shiite women the right to legal, civil and family protections. Further evidence of the Shiite parties’ hostility to genuine political reform can be found in their lack of support for recently passed reforms geared toward more inclusive governance and empowerment of the legislature. The track record of Bahrain’s elected Parliament reveals that power-hungry Islamic parties purport to advocate “democracy” yet remain firmly opposed to the notion of cooperating with the government to produce a modern nation. Instead, they prefer to embrace rejectionist politics outside of the country’s institutions by hindering progress, spouting radical rhetoric, employing extreme and violent tactics, and forcing society to adhere to the ayatollah’s Iranian-inspired theocratic fantasies. While they blare secular values to the Western media, the inherently undemocratic ideologies of these parties undermine the pluralist and progressive Bahraini society that the current establishment is committed to: the transformation process to a constitutional monarchy based on proportional representation, not sectarian loyalties. Last month, Bahrain’s crown prince, Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, initiated another round of high-level talks with various opposition parties in an attempt to revive the stillborn reconciliation efforts after the collapse of the national dialogue last year. Despite the positive international reception to the prince’s initiative, the response at home so far has been muted, with no guarantees from the opposition to ease tension and violence on the streets. Other hard-line Shiite groups, such as the February 14th Youth Coalition (named for the day in 2011 when protests erupted in Bahrain), have declared a boycott of such talks and condemned Wefaq’s participation, causing major rifts among the already fragmented opposition. In December, Bahraini and American officials exposed a cluster of foiled terror plots with clear signs of Iranian involvement, and just last Friday a policeman was killed in an attack, with responsibility claimed by Shiite militants. Bahrain finds itself at a familiar impasse in its march toward modernity. Its progressive-minded population holds on to hopes that their aspirations for a modern, responsive state will some day be realized and that Islamic radicals will come to see that their theocratic agenda is only harming the state and the people that they falsely claim to serve.

0,nikos,konstandaras,11,article,"A universally popular event common to both the Summer and Winter Olympics is the debate over whether the current host is up to the task or whether maybe the Games should find a permanent home. The argument has been running since the Olympics were revived in Athens in 1896; it has followed them to Sochi, Russia, and is likely to continue to Rio de Janeiro — returning every two years, until, after their travels around the world, the Games finally settle down. In their original setting, a verdant sanctuary to Zeus in the Peloponnese Peninsula, the Olympics lasted close to 1,200 years (from 776 B.C. to A.D. 393). The reason for their founding is lost in myth and mystery. But their purpose was clear: to bring together the finest athletes of the Greek city-states, to have them compete within a strict framework aimed at ensuring fairness, and to distinguish them from all other peoples, who were excluded. Until the Roman conquest, only Greek men could take part in the Olympics. The Games were fiercely competitive, with the winners and their cities gloating over their humiliated rivals. In the modern Olympics, global unity is the aim. In London in 2012, some 10,500 athletes from 204 national Olympic committees took part. In fact, so inclusive are the Games that 11 more national teams compete than there are member countries in the United Nations. The scholarly romantics who worked toward the revival of the Games could not have predicted that the events in Athens in 1896 — when 241 athletes from 14 nations participated and Greeks won the most medals — would mushroom into the greatest celebration of human interaction, sportsmanship and spectacle. Cheating, overcommercialization, corruption, wastefulness, terrorist threats and state repression in host countries have all injured the ideal, but no other peaceful event unites so many people from all over the world in a purpose that is both universal and uniquely personal — to try to be the best. Imagine if there was no such concept, no such meeting of humanity in peaceful competition, if the years were not punctuated by the excitement of these regular gatherings. The French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin, who was instrumental in reviving the Olympics, wanted them to rotate among cities around the world. The Greek hosts of Athens 1896, who also played a major role in the Games’ revival, wanted them to stay in Greece. After the second and third Olympics, in Paris (1900) and St. Louis (1904), garnered little public enthusiasm in their host cities, the Greek capital hosted “intermediate” Olympics in 1906; though successful and widely credited with rebooting the Games, they are not included in the International Olympic Committee’s official history. Since then, the Olympics established themselves and candidate cities have campaigned feverishly to host them. And the debate over a permanent home keeps coming back. The murky selection process of host cities, the cost overruns that invariably leave a huge debt burden, the displacement of local residents in grand construction schemes, security fears, last-minute preparations and concerns over some hosts’ human rights records and political exploitation of the Games are of continual concern for those who care about them. The Nazis’ racist propaganda in the 1936 Berlin Games, the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in a terrorist hostage crisis at Munich in 1972 and the tit-for-tat boycotts between Western countries and the Soviet bloc in Moscow in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984 are the darkest stains in modern Olympic history and good arguments for keeping alive the idea of a permanent home. In 1976, the Greek government had approved a plan to offer land near ancient Olympia for a permanent site of the Games. In 1984, the United States Senate passed a resolution expressing “the sense of the Congress that the International Olympic Committee should establish a permanent Olympic facility on a site that insulates the Games from international politics.” But it was never enacted, and hosting the Olympics remains an ambition of many countries that want to show who they are and what they can do. The Games are also seen as an opportunity for growth through investment in infrastructure. The fact that most host cities (like Athens) are left with unused facilities and huge debts seems to elude most candidates, as they consider only the benefits of development and of being at the center of the world’s attention. Because today the Olympic Village is a Global Village, locality is in a sense irrelevant. We have year-round access to Olympic hopefuls and heroes, to our villains and controversies, to the drama that sells stories and products: what matters is access to athletes and their tales. In this context, it’s the opening and closing ceremonies that become the most distinguishing feature provided by the host country. So let the Games roll on, from city to city, as long as there are countries keen to host them. If and when the time comes for them to settle down in a permanent place, nothing would be more fitting than a return to the corner of the world in which they flourished for over a thousand years. Then, nations may compete for the honor of staging opening and closing ceremonies — in Greece — which will tell the world who they are and what they can do. In this way, the Olympics will carry on as a stage for all humanity, allowing nations, like their athletes, to compete as equals for the chance to prove their difference.

0,joe,nocera,102,article,"I’d like to tell you a story about a Brazilian musician you’ve probably never heard of. Her name is Joyce Moreno; she is 66 and has been singing and composing professionally for 47 years, during which time she has made more than 30 recordings. I flipped for her music when I first heard her last spring at Birdland, in Midtown Manhattan, and I’ve been listening to her, more or less obsessively, ever since. But that’s not the reason I want to tell you about her. A few months after I first heard her play, we struck up an email correspondence. When Joyce came to New York in September for an engagement, my wife and I had dinner with her and her husband, the Brazilian drummer Tutty Moreno. And during my recent trip to Rio de Janeiro, I interviewed her, figuring that I would write about her when I got back. Somewhat to my surprise, what has stuck with me from those encounters has less to do with her music, glorious though I think it is, and more to do with the way she has conducted her career. She has lessons to teach that go well beyond music. Joyce’s career began in controversy. When she was 19, she wrote a song that began, “I was told that my man doesn’t love me.” In the Brazil of that era, her blunt, first-person, female-centric lyric was considered by many to be vulgar — not the sort of thing a woman was supposed to sing about. “It was strange,” she told me — bewildering to be at the center of such a storm at such a young age. But she never backed down from the way she approached her songwriting. In a country that didn’t exactly embrace feminism, she was always a staunch feminist, and that’s reflected in some of her best lyrics. As is true for every Brazilian of her generation, she also had to deal with the military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. In December 1968, the dictatorship issued a decree that, among other things, instituted broad censorship of the arts. Some of the country’s most important musicians, like Gilberto Gil, were imprisoned and then sent into exile. Other musicians and artists had to submit their work to the censors. Joyce recalls that she was forbidden to use words like “pregnant” in her songs. “I was censored because I had a feminine point of view,” she says. By 1980, however, the worst of the censorship had ended, and Joyce recorded a song called “Feminina,” which became, in many ways, her anthem. “Oh, Ma,” it begins. “Please explain to me, teach me Tell me, what is feminine? It’s not in the hair, the mojo or the look It’s being a female everywhere.” In the early 1980s, she had a handful of small hits, “Feminina” included. But, says Nelson Motta, a Brazilian writer and producer, “her music has never been very commercial from a Brazilian standpoint,” and, over time, she became someone who was more respected than listened to. Several times during her career, she seemed on the cusp of breaking out. Once, early in her career, she recorded an album produced by Claus Ogerman, who had arranged songs for Antônio Carlos Jobim and Frank Sinatra. For reasons that have never been clear to her, the album was never released. “It was painful,” she told me, “but I lived with it.” Years later, Verve signed her to a two-record contract. As is so often the case, however, the label and the musician had very different ideas about what the recordings should sound like. “They said they liked what I was doing,” she told me, “but then they wanted me to do something completely different.” Joyce found the experience miserable, and it reinforced her belief that she could be happy only by staying true to herself, no matter what effect that had on her career. And so it has been. She is more popular in Japan than she is in Brazil. She cuts her own records, even though it means she often has to pay for it out of her pocket. “It is a way of preserving my independence as an artist,” she said. “Joyce has never worried about being popular,” says Motta. When I saw her give a concert in Rio de Janeiro in December, there were maybe 250 people in the hall — and the admission was free. I felt disappointed for her, but it didn’t bother her at all. Afterward, she autographed copies of her new CD and posed for pictures. When I asked her about it, she said, “I’m fine with where my career is. I’ve had a very lucky life.” Would that we could all so easily make our peace with what life throws us — the good, the bad and everything in between.",297,146,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/nocera-joyce-does-it-her-way.html,2014-02-18,Joyce Does It Her Way
0,,,48,article,"Some analysts and public officials say the beleaguered euro zone is finally on the road to recovery. Unemployment has decreased slightly, though it remains high at 12 percent, and the euro zone as a whole grew by 0.3 percent in the last quarter of 2013. But theirs is an overly optimistic view. Recent data show that the economies of many European countries remain very weak, and the euro zone as a whole could soon experience deflation, a decline in the general level of prices, if government officials and central bankers do not take steps to bolster the economy. Last month, inflation in the 18 countries that use the euro was just 0.7 percent, down from 0.8 percent in December. That is far below the European Central Bank’s target for an inflation rate of just under 2 percent. Deflation is a pernicious and self-reinforcing phenomenon that debilitates economies, as Japan experienced for much of the past 15 years. When prices fall broadly, consumers put off purchases and businesses see little value in investing for the future, creating a downward spiral. Deflation also makes it more difficult for governments and other borrowers to repay their debts. Earlier this month, the central bank’s president, Mario Draghi, dismissed the fear of deflation, but his words were hardly reassuring. “There is certainly going to be subdued inflation, low inflation for an extended, protracted period of time, but no deflation,” he said. If the bank believes that prices will increase so slowly, the right thing to do is to lower interest rates and pump more money into the economy through bond purchases. Yet it announced no new policies at its February meeting. The central bank’s inaction is particularly disconcerting because it is the only public institution that could provide a boost to the weak euro-zone economy. Under pressure from Germany, governments across the euro zone have committed to cutting spending and raising taxes in a counterproductive effort to reduce their fiscal deficits. European officials have also delayed and watered down plans to create a euro-zone banking union, which is needed to recapitalize or shut down troubled financial institutions that have become a burden on strained economies like Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. There is another problem. Thousands of Germans have joined in a lawsuit to challenge the central bank’s authority to buy bonds issued by European governments under a program Mr. Draghi announced in 2012 but has never used. The Federal Constitutional Court in Germany recently ruled that the central bank cannot legally buy government bonds, but it did not block such purchases. Instead, it sent the case to the European Court of Justice. Central bank officials say it can buy bonds while that case is pending, but it might be less inclined to do so given the legal uncertainty. Ideally, the central bank and European governments would work together to revive the economy of the euro zone. But since that is unlikely, it is up to the central bank to act when it meets again next month.",48,120,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/europe-flirts-with-deflation.html,2014-02-18,Europe Flirts With Deflation
0,,,3,article,"Gov. Chris Christie and his political allies have done the near-impossible. Their notorious traffic jam at the George Washington Bridge, engineered by Mr. Christie’s colleagues, has succeeded in getting people to pay attention to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the sprawling and secretive agency that runs not only that bridge but three other major bridges, two tunnels, five airports and port operations in the region. And, like many of those huge structures, the authority itself desperately needs fixing. The authority is overseen jointly by Governor Christie and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York. It has an annual budget of $8.2 billion, and there are plans to spend another $27.6 billion in capital improvements over the next decade, making the authority the one of the most important government agencies in both states. Over the years, the Port Authority has often served as a political candy jar, providing patronage jobs for political allies. Mr. Christie has been particularly skillful at doling out well-paid jobs at the authority to his supporters. By most counts, there are at least 50 agency employees who owe their jobs to the New Jersey governor. The traffic scandal that has resulted in numerous investigations and two resignations of Christie appointees is just the latest example of how governance of the Port Authority is tainted by personal politics. And because two states share executive control, and thus responsibility, there is no meaningful oversight. Major structural reforms would require legislative approval in Albany and Trenton, which would be hard but definitely worth a try. New Jersey, for instance, could help matters by enacting the equivalent of a reform law approved in New York that, among other things, required board members to pledge to uphold their fiduciary duties to their agency’s mission, not to their patron in the governor’s mansion. Short of that, the two governors should make changes that could make the authority less political and more professional. The Port Authority’s 12-member board of commissioners is appointed by the governors, six by each. They should be appointed on the basis of their professional qualifications, not political connections, as so often happens, and held to six-year term limits. Some holdovers have been there for more than 10 years. Each commissioner should also publicly disclose potential conflicts of interest well before the authority makes its decisions. These potential conflicts should be regularly displayed on the Port Authority’s website. Commissioners have routinely been allowed to lobby for contracts that could affect personal businesses and, only later after the decision is made, would they formally recuse themselves in the official minutes. Their recusal in each case should be announced at the public board meeting. Under the traditional power-sharing arrangement, New Jersey appoints the chairman of the board, New York the executive director. That worked well until 1995, when Gov. George Pataki of New York chose an incompetent executive. The move so angered New Jersey’s governor at the time, Christine Todd Whitman, that she demanded the right to appoint a deputy executive director as well. That change gives New Jersey more power over day-to-day decisions. It’s time to allow the executive to pick his or her own deputy after consulting with the board. The authority is notoriously secretive, despite some recent efforts to provide more information on its website. It is time to require more transparency, including clear public announcements of all items approved by the board while in public session. The authority should also have to answer to rigorous freedom of information laws in both states. There must be stronger protections for whistle-blowers, and the two state legislatures should not approve commissioners until they have been carefully vetted for conflicts of interest as well as professional qualifications. Mr. Christie should want to make these changes, if only to show he’s aware of the damage his people have done. Mr. Cuomo should embrace them as an expression of his interest in sound government. One interesting aspect of the current mess is that the authority was created more than 90 years ago not only to address the shared needs of both states but also to wring out as much local patronage and politics as possible. Mr. Christie has shown how easy it is to turn back the clock.",16,62,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/the-port-authority-loses-its-way.html,2014-02-18,The Port Authority Loses Its Way
0,,,123,article,"The slaughter of the dwindling elephant herds in Africa grows worse by the year as organized criminals get rich from selling elephant tusks in lucrative black markets around the world, where a pound of ivory can fetch $1,500. African elephants, whose numbers have been reduced in less than a century from several million to an estimated 500,000, are being killed at a rate of 30,000 to 35,000 a year. Now the Obama administration wants to ban virtually all of the elephant ivory trade in the United States. Last week, the Interior Department’s Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it will ban the trade in elephant ivory within the United States by prohibiting all imports and — with very narrow exemptions — exports and resales by auction houses and other dealers. If rigorously enforced, the new rules should help slow the killings in Africa; the United States is the second-largest market for ivory in the world. Daniel Ashe, the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the “unregulated domestic trade in elephant ivory has served as a loophole that gives cover for illegal trade.” The service will prohibit “all commercial imports of African elephant ivory, including antiques,” and it will prohibit exports except for certified antiques. Sales of elephant ivory across state lines will be prohibited, unless the ivory is demonstrably more than 100 years old. And ivory sales will be prohibited within a state unless the seller can demonstrate that the ivory was lawfully imported before 1990, the year after the signing of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, a United Nations agreement known as Cites. The burden of proof of purchase will fall on the seller, and sales will require rigorous documentation. People can still own ivory and pass heirlooms to descendants. Still, much will depend on whether Washington and the relevant departments — Interior, Justice and Treasury — are willing to put serious money and muscle into the program. Criminals who have killed these majestic animals and brought them illegally to market are unlikely to be worried about forging a few documents saying that their ivory is old enough to be exempt. Assemblyman Robert Sweeney of Long Island supports a ban on all ivory sales in New York State, without exception. That would be tougher than the federal ban. But the federal ban will cover a wider market. It is a timely and welcome move.",482,328,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/banning-ivory-sales-in-america.html,2014-02-18,Banning Ivory Sales in America
0,david,brooks,2409,article,"We take as our text today the parable of the prodigal sons. As I hope you know, the story is about a father with two sons. The younger son took his share of the inheritance early and blew it on prostitutes and riotous living. When the money was gone, he returned home. His father ran out and embraced him. The delighted father offered the boy his finest robe and threw a feast in his honor. The older son, the responsible one, was appalled. He stood outside the feast, crying in effect, “Look! All these years I’ve been working hard and obeying you faithfully, and you never gave me special treatment such as this!” The father responded, “You are always with me, and everything I have is yours.” But he had to celebrate the younger one’s return. The boy was lost and now is found. Did the father do the right thing? Is the father the right model for authority today? The father’s critics say he was unjust. People who play by the rules should see the rewards. Those who abandon the community, live according to their own reckless desires should not get to come back and automatically reap the bounty of others’ hard work. If you reward the younger brother, you signal that self-indulgence pays, while hard work gets slighted. The father’s example is especially pernicious now, the critics continue. Jesus preached it at the time of the Pharisees, in an overly rigid and rule-bound society. In those circumstances, a story of radical forgiveness was a useful antidote to the prevailing legalism. But we don’t live in that kind of society. We live in a society in which moral standards are already fuzzy, in which people are already encouraged to do their own thing. We live in a society with advanced social decay — with teens dropping out of high school, financiers plundering companies and kids being raised without fathers. The father’s example in the parable reinforces loose self-indulgence at a time when we need more rule-following, more social discipline and more accountability, not less. It’s a valid critique, but I’d defend the father’s example, and, informed by a reading of Timothy Keller’s outstanding book “The Prodigal God,” I’d even apply the father’s wisdom to social policy-making today. We live in a divided society in which many of us in the middle- and upper-middle classes are like the older brother and many of the people who drop out of school, commit crimes and abandon their children are like the younger brother. In many cases, we have a governing class of elder brothers legislating programs on behalf of the younger brothers. The great danger in this situation is that we in the elder brother class will end up self-righteously lecturing the poor: “You need to be more like us: graduate from school, practice a little sexual discipline, work harder.” But the father in this parable exposes the truth that people in the elder brother class are stained, too. The elder brother is self-righteous, smug, cold and shrewd. The elder brother wasn’t really working to honor his father; he was working for material reward and out of a fear-based moralism. The father reminds us of the old truth that the line between good and evil doesn’t run between people or classes; it runs straight through every human heart. The father also understands that the younger brothers of the world will not be reformed and re-bound if they feel they are being lectured to by unpleasant people who consider themselves models of rectitude. Imagine if the older brother had gone out to greet the prodigal son instead of the father, giving him some patronizing lecture. Do we think the younger son would have reformed his life to become a productive member of the community? No. He would have gotten back up and found some bad-boy counterculture he could join to reassert his dignity. The father teaches that rebinding and reordering society requires an aggressive assertion: You are accepted; you are accepted. It requires mutual confession and then a mutual turning toward some common project. Why does the father organize a feast? Because a feast is nominally about food, but, in Jewish life, it is really about membership. It reasserts your embedded role in the community project. The father’s lesson for us is that if you live in a society that is coming apart on class lines, the best remedies are oblique. They are projects that bring the elder and younger brothers together for some third goal: national service projects, infrastructure-building, strengthening a company or a congregation. The father offers each boy a precious gift. The younger son gets to dedicate himself to work and self-discipline. The older son gets to surpass the cold calculus of utility and ambition, and experience the warming embrace of solidarity and companionship.",4547,2844,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/brooks-the-prodigal-sons.html,2014-02-18,The Prodigal Sons
0,frank,bruni,121,article,"Her perseverance often awes me. Her arrogance sometimes galls me. And her particular braid of high-mindedness and high-handedness almost always leaves me puzzled and exhausted. But what I’ve been feeling for and about Hillary Clinton over the last week is sadness. Does she have even a smidgen of privacy left? Can she utter a syllable or think a thought with any assurance that it won’t be exposed, analyzed, ridiculed? When she was talking decades ago with Diane Blair, whose journals are part of “The Hillary Papers,” she no doubt assumed an audience of one: her dear friend. Her best friend. But this corner of Hillary’s life, like every other, has now been put on public display. Get as close as you like. Gawk. Judge. I’m not suggesting that The Washington Free Beacon, the news site that presented “The Hillary Papers,” did anything unusual or wrong. By recognizing that an archive of documents at the University of Arkansas hadn’t received much scrutiny and going through it, The Free Beacon provided candid, intimate glimpses of the Clintons that hadn’t existed before. This was indeed a scoop, one that many other media organizations would have been happy to trumpet. But to absorb it in the context of the endless drip-drip-drip about Hillary over the years was to worry that we’ve lost sight of any boundaries and limits — that maybe even Hillary herself has stopped hoping for anything kinder. When the archive was opened to the public in 2010, she gave a tribute to Blair, who died in 2000. Details in the documents were fresh. Most of the truths they fleshed out weren’t. We already knew that Hillary had found tortured rationales for Bill’s infidelities. We already knew that her compromised brand of feminism accommodated the vilification of women who dared to threaten the couple’s purchase on power. What’s at least as interesting is what the documents say about the political arena that the Clintons inhabit: the toll it takes, the cynics it makes. Early in her White House years, Hillary’s guard has already gone up. Blair chats with Janet Reno, Bill Clinton’s attorney general, and writes, in April 1993, that while “Janet wants to connect” with Hillary, she “finds HC a ‘mask.’ ” This is even before the fever pitch of impeachment and the Starr Report in all its lurid detail and the sustained analysis of every provisional hairstyle and the millions of pages by authors determined to turn her into a symbol of this, that or the other. She has been called a Rorschach, but as I read “The Hillary Papers,” I couldn’t stop thinking of her as a carcass. With a tireless zest, we pick her clean. The latest book about her, “HRC,” by the journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, was published last week. It focuses on recent years, and is flattering: The Hillary here is resourceful and diligent and has enough guile and grace to win over the people whom she sets out to. She’s also obsessed with loyalty, which governs her decisions, leading to bad ones. That’s perhaps inevitable when you’ve been so thoroughly peered and poked at. You do your damnedest to carve out a safe space. Blair was surely supposed to be that, and it’s not clear why she was taking notes or what she intended to do with them. It’s also not clear that the Hillary in those notes is the truest one. With our friends, yes, we bare our souls. But we also let off steam, allowing ourselves a theatricality and sloppiness that exaggerate our emotions. Blair’s journals are the kind of material from which biographies and histories have long been woven. But it doesn’t always surface so soon, and it is now augmented by the eavesdropping and tattling of cabinet secretaries (see “Duty,” by Robert Gates) and political allies and handlers eager to make themselves look better, even at a benefactor’s expense (see “Game Change” and the robust genre to which it belongs). Frenzied media feed on this, to a degree that arguably goes beyond our obligation to keep politicians honest, and it’s troubling in two regards. How many decent, gifted people who contemplate public office look at what someone like Hillary endures and step away? And the people who aren’t scared off: How cold and hard are they, or how cold and hard do they become? “HRC” recalls that just after the 2008 presidential election, a photo came to light of one of Barack Obama’s speechwriters, Jon Favreau, pretending to cup the breast of a cardboard cutout of Hillary. The image is shocking, but then again not. For a good long while, we’ve done with Hillary as we pleased, frequently looking past her humanity, routinely running roughshod over her secrets. She has gained so much — tremendous influence, significant riches — but lost so much, too. Was that the bargain she expected? Has she made peace with it?",257,166,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/bruni-hillarys-secrets.html,2014-02-18,Hillary’s Secrets
0,ilinca,calugareanu,1316,article,"I was raised in Romania in the 1980s, under a Communist regime that, among countless repressions, reduced television to two hours a day of dull propaganda, traditional music, patriotic poems and censored films. One day when I was 6, my parents found a way to borrow a VCR. They invited their friends, and all night they watched grainy VHS tapes of Hollywood B-movies. I remember the films, but more so I remember how I felt when I stepped into the living room — like walking into a secret, magical and free world. All the dialogue on these movies was dubbed into Romanian in a husky, high-pitched woman’s voice. Throughout my childhood, these films provided a glimpse into the forbidden West, resplendent with blue jeans, Coke and skyscrapers. As Hollywood movies became ubiquitous through the black market, this voice became one of the most recognizable in Romania. Yet no one knew who she was. After the 1989 revolution I learned the true story, which I present here in this Op-Doc video. In 1985, Irina Margareta Nistor, a young translator at the national television station, met a mysterious entrepreneur. He was smuggling, copying and distributing movies on VHS tapes.

0,hugh,raffles,595,article,"THE Department of Environmental Conservation is proposing to kill New York State’s entire population of free-ranging mute swans, those graceful white water birds long treasured as symbols of romance and fidelity. New Yorkers have until Feb. 21 to submit responses to a plan that calls for the removal by 2025 of the estimated 2,200 birds by methods that could include shooting, gassing, decapitation and egg addling. Mute swans — so called because they’re not generally vocal, their most arresting sound being the beating of their wings — arrived in New York from Europe in the late 19th century, imported as aristocratic decoration for country estates. They adapted with ease and soon spread to public lands, where they were embraced for their beauty and as evidence of environmental health. Only in recent decades, as conservationists’ preoccupation with the geographical origins of species has intensified, have these immigrants with established communities on Long Island, in the Hudson Valley and on Lake Ontario become perceived as a problem. The decisive moment came in 2004, when the United States Congress, under pressure from an alliance of waterfowl hunters and conservation organizations, including the National Audubon Society and the American Bird Conservancy, revised the Migratory Bird Treaty Act specifically to withdraw protection from mute swans and other nonnative species. Wildlife managers see mute swans as an invasive species, whose year-round residence, wanton appetite for subaquatic vegetation and aggressive territoriality threaten unsuspecting humans, native wildfowl such as the black tern, and dwindling wetland habitat. But many New Yorkers have a different view. After all, these are regal birds, protected in Europe and celebrated in myth, poetry and song. Many people share W. B. Yeats’s vision of them as “mysterious, beautiful” creatures that “delight men’s eyes,” and they feel grateful for the otherworldly serenity that a mating pair or, even better, a snow-white flock can bring to the neighborhood pond in this age of municipal austerity. Mute swans are defensive, not aggressive, their advocates say. If people carelessly encroach on their nests and young, they should expect to be unequivocally rebuffed. If the birds have an appetite for subaquatic vegetation, it may have local effects, but as they compose about half of 1 percent of New York’s more than 400,000 waterfowl, the impact on the state’s ecosystems is minor. And if, as the state claims but has difficulty demonstrating, mute swans really displace New York’s native birds, there should be a debate about the criteria used to value one species over another. The state’s management plan is based on a D.E.C. study that produced some markedly inconclusive science. The threat from New York’s swans appears largely speculative: The study’s authors base their assumptions on programs to control growing numbers of mute swans in Michigan and the Chesapeake Bay, yet as the report itself shows, the birds’ populations in New York State are relatively small and currently either steady or in decline. It’s hard to resist concluding that the startling plan to eliminate the swans statewide is a case of bureaucratic overreach. Swan lovers are unlikely to be placated by the proposal to license small numbers of clipped birds on private lands. We live on a planet where not only are the fates of all species profoundly entwined, but where, one way or another, all plants, animals and natural phenomena have been touched by our often heavy human hands. What’s more, we’ve turned out to be unreliable managers of nature, allowing our interventions to be driven by interest groups and underwritten by unholy compromises. We have swerved from paradigm to paradigm as we rewrite our models of natural processes according to contemporary fashion: Even now, for example, we struggle to determine how best to use fire in our forests, and how to cope with poorly conceived biological controls like the harlequin ladybird, a nonnative species introduced in America to tackle aphids that has displaced indigenous ladybugs. There’s no question that species designated as nonnative can affect our ecosystems, sometimes changing them in ways that are expensive and undesirable. Dramatic examples abound — zebra mussels, cane toads, kudzu. But as more and more research is demonstrating, “nonnative” is an ideological grab bag of a category whose members are varied in their impacts and diverse in their contributions. Nonnative species may be beneficial, rather than harmful. They may also be well integrated into their environment, particularly if, like the mute swan and the honeybee — another European transplant, brought here in the early 17th century — they have been resident in their host ecosystems for a substantial amount of time. Indeed, given the limited scale of their impact, it’s difficult to imagine that mute swans would be considered a nuisance if they were also considered native. Under these conditions, we should carefully examine the evidence offered by New York State in support of its plan and consider whether it is adequate to condemn a much-loved species and allow its wholesale killing. There’s a larger issue here. The real environmental problems faced by New York State are created not by birds, but by people. In the nearly 150 years that the mute swan has been among us, it has witnessed a radical decline in the extent of the state’s wildlife habitat and in the quality of its water and soil. The loss of wetlands has slowed and even reversed since the low point of the 1970s, but splintering habitat, sea-level rise, legislative loopholes, untreated sewage discharge and contaminated runoff from agriculture, and adjacent development continue to threaten these vital ecosystems. Because of their limited diet, mute swans are a sentinel species, concentrating contaminants in their livers and revealing the presence of chemical toxicities in fresh water. Rather than eliminating swans, we should pay attention to their struggle to survive and what it can tell us about the state of our state.",949,788,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/speaking-up-for-the-mute-swan.html,2014-02-18,Speaking Up for the Mute Swan

Since French and African Union troops arrived there in December with a United Nations-sanctioned mission to prevent mass murder, the situation has degenerated alarmingly. The United Nations estimates that 2.5 million people, more than half the population of the country, need help, but sectarian killings are making it impossible to reach them. On Saturday, France pledged to add 400 troops to its force of 1,600 that is now working with about 5,500 African Union peacekeepers. These troops are overwhelmed by the scale of the violence. Disturbingly, some Chadian forces among the African Union peacekeepers are colluding with Muslim fighters, which include mercenaries from Chad and Sudan, who prey on Christian civilians. In Bangui, the Muslim population has largely fled.  Christian militias have taken advantage of the chaos to engage in horrific ethnic cleansing of Muslims. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, warned last week that genocide and the partition of the country are real risks. Catherine Samba-Panza, who became interim president of the republic on Jan. 20, has vowed to keep the country whole. Over the weekend, some Christian militias showed interest in beginning to talk about security. The European Union has pledged 500 troops to help establish a safe haven in Bangui. The United Nations has released an additional $10 million from its emergency humanitarian fund. These efforts are hardly enough. Donor countries pledged $207 million in humanitarian aid at a meeting last month, though only 28 percent of the money has been committed or disbursed. The United Nations’ $551 million strategic response plan is only 13 percent funded. Donors need to fulfill their pledges immediately. Rogue members of the peacekeeping forces  must be held accountable. The International Criminal Court has opened a preliminary investigation into war crimes. Far more international peacekeepers must be deployed quickly to avert a catastrophe and to let President Samba-Panza prepare for elections by next February. Without urgent action, the Central African Republic’s descent into chaos will soon be unstoppable.

0,,,1,article,"Weaknesses in Germany’s art restitution laws were laid bare last year by the discovery in a Munich apartment of a trove of 1,280 artworks, some of them suspected of having been looted during the Nazis’ seizure of “degenerate art.”  Now, amid rising complaints and disputes over provenance, the German culture minister, Monika Grütters, has wisely proposed the creation of an independent center to search the nation’s museum collections systematically for stolen art. There is no such central authority now in a country where regional governments and separate museums exercise most cultural power. The hunt for looted art was given fresh urgency by the public disclosure of the Munich trove, which included works by Matisse, Chagall and Picasso, found in the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of a Nazi-era art dealer. A second cache of 60 works by modern masters was discovered last week in Mr. Gurlitt’s residence in Salzburg, Austria, raising questions of how many other art stashes there might be and how to determine the rightful owners. So far, about 380 works found in the Munich apartment have been identified as seized from German museums in the 1930s, with an additional 590 still being investigated, according to authorities in Bavaria. Mr. Gurlitt initially said he would not “voluntarily give back anything,” but his lawyers later said he would be more cooperative. The Gurlitt trove was disclosed in a magazine article in November. Bavarian officials had sought to keep it secret, despite Germany’s participation in international agreements on art restitution. In the aftermath of angry complaints worldwide, the German government announced the creation last year of a task force of specialists to track the provenance of the works. Ms. Grutters is aiming to start the independent group’s search through museum collections this year. She endorsed another needed step being debated in the upper house of Parliament — updating the current 30-year statute of limitations so that the heirs of Jewish art owners and dealers can file restitution claims for art stolen during World War II.",1,12,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/tracking-plundered-art.html,2014-02-18,Tracking Plundered Art
0,francesco,giavazzi,1,article,"Europe is lurching toward an overhaul of its banking system. Later this year, the European Central Bank is set to assume the authority to supervise the 130 largest banks in the euro zone — a momentous process of centralizing financial regulation in Frankfurt aimed at preventing another round of the bank failures that contributed to the 2007-8 global financial crisis. In preparation for the handoff, the E.C.B. will conduct a “stress test” to gauge how the banks would fare if economic conditions deteriorated. But the central bank’s point person for these efforts, Danièle Nouy, appears to have misdiagnosed the problem, suggesting that “insufficient transparency regarding the balance sheets of the European banks” is the critical problem. Many of the large banks own huge amounts of government bonds that were issued by countries whose ability to fully repay their debts is in doubt. If the countries default, the banks will go broke. This risk is paralyzing the banks, which consequently shy away from lending. Without lending, Europe’s economies are not growing, which reduces tax revenues and makes a default on the bonds all the more likely. To avoid such a vicious cycle, the E.C.B. should keep in mind three lessons from Japan and the United States about how to properly use stress tests to stabilize its banks. The first is that the main reason to care about the banks is that the credit they extend is essential for growth. The point of a stress test is to make sure that banks are strong enough to lend and, if they are not, to fix the problem. The second is that weak banks have powerful incentives to roll over bad loans (or hold on to impaired assets) to avoid taking losses. Acknowledging losses would reduce the value of shareholder equity and would expose management to criticism. The alternative is to raise more capital and hold management accountable. Absent fresh capital, attempts to protect taxpayers from having to bail out the banks mean that the banks will not extend more credit — because the new loans might go bad, too. The third is that stress tests need to come with a plan to restore lending. Japan had a banking crisis in the late 1990s that it finally tackled in 2003. American banks were nearly broke after the 2008 crisis. In both cases, regulators used cleverly designed stress tests: They calculated potential losses by the banks and, once the results were announced, the banks had to make adjustments. In Japan, many large banks were deemed undercapitalized: Management was replaced (and managers’ pay was restricted) and the banks had to raise new capital (and while doing so they could not pay dividends). In the United States, the government offered money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program as a backstop after the Federal Reserve stress tests concluded that its 19 largest banks were at risk of losing more than $600 billion and that they needed about $75 billion in capital to survive in the worst-case scenario. The banks were given six months to plug their deficits and told if they did not do it on their own, the government would use the TARP money to invest in the banks on terms that would be attractive to the government but unattractive to existing shareholders. The result: The American banks raised more than $50 billion in new equity in one month, and another $120 billion over the next 18 months. The backstop was not needed. Europe’s poorly conceived prior stress tests in 2010 and 2011 failed on all fronts. Most important, little capital was raised. Between 2011 and the middle of last year, European banks raised less than 75 billion euros ($103 billion), though their total assets are greater than American banks’. Poor decisions by regulators enabled these failures. One was to allow the banks to determine their health by comparing their capital to their assets — rather than the amount needed to support the credit needs of the economy. Given the choice of raising new capital or reducing their size so that their capital base was commensurate with a smaller level of perceived risk, the banks’ shareholders and executives chose the latter, easier option. This meant less lending, and economic stagnation. A second failure involved the government bonds held by European banks. The previous stress tests hid behind an accounting gimmick, pretending that if banks promised to hold on to the bonds, the bonds would be immune to losses. Of course, if there is a default, the losses will have to be recognized. And if default appears imminent, depositors and others who fund the banks will fear losses are coming and stop funding them. Unless the banks have an adequate equity cushion to protect them from this possibility, they will again be unable to lend. Europe needs a credible plan to rehabilitate its banks. The most direct way would be for the governments of the euro zone to pool resources and issue the same ultimatum America did: Raise more capital or our governments will invest in your banks in ways that will benefit taxpayers and disadvantage your shareholders. The economists Viral V. Acharya and Sascha Steffen have estimated that the capital backstop needed could exceed 500 billion euros. That’s a huge number to swallow — yet it is essential for leaders to stop understating and to show the political will it takes to plug the hole. Until now, peculiar rules have also given shareholders too much power to prevent European banks from raising new equity. For example, Italian charities have lobbied to prevent or delay plans for banks to raise new capital, with surprising compliance from regulators at the Bank of Italy. The byzantine governance structure of Crédit Agricole in France puts potential equity investors at a disadvantage, relative to the regional cooperative that controls the bank. Mr. Acharya and Mr. Steffen estimate that banks in France are the most undercapitalized of all banks in the euro zone. With the new stress tests, the European Central Bank has a chance to change course. But to do that it needs to break with past practices and do what other countries have shown it takes to make sure that banks are no longer an obstacle to growth.

0,jonathan,sullivan,97,article,"NOTTINGHAM, England — Government officials from China and Taiwan met last week for the first time in an official capacity in more than six decades. The talks were uneventful — producing modest agreements to establish communication channels and other practical arrangements — but they were symbolic of the strengthening of cross-Strait ties under President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan. Since being elected in 2008, Mr. Ma has adopted a conciliatory approach toward China and pushed through a number of cooperative policies, including a free-trade agreement. While most Taiwanese strongly favor maintaining Taiwan’s functional independence, Mr. Ma has started an irreversible trend toward closer ties and political negotiation with Beijing. Economic interaction is the force that drives this trend, but it’s more comprehensive than one based on economics alone. For decades, hostilities between the Kuomintang (K.M.T.) government in Taiwan and the Chinese Communist Party led to a policy on the Taiwan side of “no contact, no compromise and no negotiation.” Even as China opened up and Taiwanese investors and manufacturers brought the two economies together, political relations remained deadlocked. Tentative contacts in the early 1990s were stalled by what Beijing called the “secessionist” policies of former presidents Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian. When he became president in 2008, Mr. Ma announced that, contrary to his predecessor, he would accept the idea of “one China, different interpretations” that is Beijing’s bottom-line position. Mr. Ma’s unequivocal assurances soon led to the expansion of transportation links, suspension of competition for diplomatic allies and  agreements on crime, food safety, tourism and education. But Taiwan’s separation from the mainland continues to remind China’s leaders of colonial, in particular Japanese, bullying at the end of the 19th century. The new Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has held up the “Chinese Dream” as the maxim for his leadership, aiming to recapture the prestige that was lost during “100 years of national shame.” A major component of that goal is restoring lost territory, chiefly Taiwan, which was ceded to Japan in 1895 following the first of a series of military defeats and invasions that are the source of continuing Chinese antipathy. Defeat by the Communists in the Chinese civil war forced the K.M.T., and its army and supporters, to evacuate to Taiwan, where it ruled through martial law for four decades before steering the island toward democracy in the late 1980s. It is only in recent months that Mr. Xi has been able to devote his energy to the Taiwan issue. Since his rise to the top of the Communist Party in late 2012, Mr. Xi has been preoccupied with consolidating power and setting out an ambitious plan to reform the economy, while launching an internal anticorruption campaign and managing deteriorating relations with Japan. Mr. Xi showed his determination to press for political talks at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Bali last October, where he told a Taiwanese representative that progress toward a political resolution must be accelerated. Now that Mr. Xi’s house is in better order, and as the China-friendly Mr. Ma enters the final two years of his presidency, there is a renewed sense of urgency in both camps. Mr. Ma’s many opponents, including those in his own party, note that his enthusiasm for pursuing links with China is not in line with public opinion. Surveys over the past 20 years show a consistently large majority of Taiwanese, over 80 percent in the most recent poll late last year, support some version of the status quo. Support for immediate or future unification was less than 12 percent. Mr. Ma’s approach will be put to the test in 2016 when voters go to the polls to choose his successor. Although some say that Mr. Ma has been overly accommodating, there is every reason to expect continuity in Taiwan’s policy toward China if the K.M.T. retains the presidency. A victory for the Democratic Progressive Party, on the other hand, is likely to bring about a period of uncertainty in China-Taiwan relations. Long a staunch defender of Taiwan’s autonomy, the D.P.P. has shown a willingness to engage with China, but the policy platform it recently put forward as a basis for conducting cross-Strait relations was swiftly rejected by Beijing. Still, a D.P.P. victory would slow down the process, but is unlikely to reverse the long-term trend toward closer ties. Taiwan’s economy depends on trade, and China is its biggest export destination and source of a huge trade surplus. China is central to the supply chains of Taiwanese manufacturers, and 80 percent of Taiwanese foreign direct investment goes to China. A significant add-on to the free trade agreement in the area of services and trade awaits ratification in Taiwan’s legislature. Aside from this economic interdependence, China imposes its power on Taiwan in many ways, creating momentum that is difficult to withstand indefinitely. The area across the strait from Taiwan is lined with Chinese missiles. Chinese influence and opposition restricts Taiwan’s participation in international society, including signing other bilateral and regional economic agreements. China exerts influence on hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese businesspeople residing in China, and has started to target Taiwanese politics, allegedly contributing to election campaigns, mobilizing influential supporters and investing in Taiwanese media. Against these formidable pressures, Taiwan has limited resources to call upon. Its most potent weapon is its robust democracy. The moral support that Taiwan claims from the international community for its mode of governance is an important constraint on China. Any leader in Taipei who attempts to preserve the status quo of functional independence can rightly say that the government is merely following public opinion. The Taiwanese people desire the peace and prosperity that positive relations with China could bring, yet they do not want to give up their sovereignty or democracy to achieve it. But Beijing’s position is implacable, and its power and influence is inescapable. As it ramps up the pressure on Taiwan in different ways, there is an inevitable drift toward the unification that China craves.

0,roger,cohen,107,article,"LONDON —  Pity poor Scotland. Within days it has been warned that if it has the temerity to vote for independence in September it can forget about a currency union with the pound and forget about becoming a member of the European Union, two ideas Scottish nationalist leaders have presented as entirely feasible. The first warning came from George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, who declared that, “If Scotland walks away from the U.K. it walks away from the U.K. pound.” He added that “there’s no legal reason why the rest of the U.K. would need to share its currency with Scotland.” The second was delivered by José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, who told the BBC it would be “extremely difficult, if not impossible,” for Scotland to join the European Union because it would require the unanimous approval of other member states. That was a remote possibility given the dim view taken by some countries, notably Catalonia-fearing Spain, on secession. Spain, Barroso noted, had not recognized Kosovo, which broke away from Serbia. “Bluff, bluster and bullying” was the verdict of Alex Salmond, the leader of the Scottish National Party and the campaign for independence, to Osborne’s apparent threat. John Swinney, Scotland’s finance minister, called Barroso’s remarks “pretty preposterous.” Scots, both men suggested, would not be cowed. The battle for Scotland is heating up 307 years after the union of 1707. A pretty successful union it has been, too, but, unthreatened and restless, Scots troop off to Norway, another small country with oil, and think, hey, why not? Some are more inclined to recall the victory over the English at the Battle of Bannockburn 700 years ago than Englishmen and Scots together in the trenches of World War I a century ago. Recent polls suggest a close outcome, with the plurality that favors staying inside the union eroding fast. The refusal of David Cameron, the British prime minister, to debate Salmond has not helped the union’s cause. The Tories are cordially disliked in Scotland. Cameron, an old Etonian, has been singled out as a “toff” out of touch with ordinary people. Scots distrust him. They are overwhelmingly favorable to the European Union, about which the prime minister has shown a fatal ambiguity, possibly opening the door to Britain’s departure. Two points need underlining. The first is that the threats from Osborne and Barroso are ill-advised and could well rebound against them. The Scots are proud people. It is wiser to debate them than admonish them, or raise the specter of isolation from afar. The second is that Britain in Europe, its union intact, offers the best chance for the nation to count and prosper in the 21st century. A Scottish departure, followed by rump Britain limping out of the European Union, would be a disaster. It is a safe bet that the Northern Irish question, quieted but unresolved, would then resurface with a vengeance. Imagine the Chinese gazing at the North Sea after this fragmentation and trying to make out what the little speck of land bobbing around out there signifies. That said, Scots must look south these days and wonder. Growing areas of England are under water, a fact Cameron has been among the last to grasp. Politicians appear to spend much of their time squabbling over how to dredge a river. Officials issue frantic edicts on “health and safety.” A barmy prince declares that “there is nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something.” The world’s financial center is turning into the world’s aquatic center, its main attraction a ship of fools. At the helm sits Cameron drifting across the Somerset Levels. Thames floodwaters are closing in on London; his Environment Agency is a laughing stock run by a man a member of his own Conservative party has called a “little git.” There are shades of the Hurricane Katrina debacle. Chris Smith, the chairman of the Environment Agency, has become Britain’s Michael Brown, the American disaster-response director of whom President George W. Bush famously observed, “Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job.” Smith is doing a heck of a job. Scots seem to be drawing the conclusion that they would be better off by themselves. (They might, however, want to take a closer look at the balance sheets of Scottish banks before breaking away.) “We want you to stay,” Cameron pleaded in a recent speech. The Gettysburg Address it was not. He sounded sincere even if the thought must cross his mind that the chances of Labor ever winning an election again would be minimal, absent Scotland. He might then rule in perpetuity. That is a very sobering thought. The satirist Peter Cook once suggested Britain was about to sink “giggling into the sea.” Never has that vision seemed closer. Giggle away. The bits of Britain could go one by one.",83,132,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/cohen-britannia-rues-the-waves.html,2014-02-18,Britannia Rues the Waves
0,bill,keller,36,article,"South Africa — the democratic version fathered by Nelson Mandela — turns 20 this year. Like most adolescents emerging into adulthood, it has issues. It could use more impulse control, better self-esteem, less conformity to peer pressure and some plain old parental wisdom. For those of us who watch and root for this struggling young democracy, the year began with a disappointing setback. In case you missed it, an anti-apartheid luminary named Mamphela Ramphele announced that she was joining the Democratic Alliance, giving that opposition party its most prominent black headliner and its most credible candidate for the presidency in the elections expected in the spring. Then a few days later the deal fell apart, embarrassing both Ramphele and the D.A., and extinguishing a moment of promise. Apparently, while her financial backers were pushing her toward a partnership, her network of followers was not ready for it. (A South African news site, The Daily Maverick, received “unconfirmed reports” that one of the donors who helped nudge Ramphele into the deal was Bill Gates. In several days of badgering a Gates spokesman, I was unable to get a straight answer.) Don’t get me wrong. I did not see the remotest chance that Ramphele would actually become the next president. She is astonishingly accomplished, with a résumé that includes medicine, academia, business and international banking, and she suffered abundantly for the cause of South African freedom, but she seems more at home at a board meeting than a campaign rally. (Her base, as John McCain used to say about himself, was the press corps.) And the Democratic Alliance has traditionally been the anti-apartheid party of white and mixed-race liberals in a country that is 80 percent black and still pretty tribal in its loyalties. Gwede Mantashe, the secretary general of the ruling African National Congress, dismissed the D.A.’s recruitment of Ramphele as “rent-a-black,” an insult that was crudely offensive and probably politically effective. The Democratic Alliance “is still a hard sell for the majority of black people, regardless of whose face is on the ballot paper,” said Vukani Mde, an editor at the Independent Newspapers group, writing in Johannesburg’s The Star. “Electoral politics in this country is still very much a game of identity.” But there were several reasons to hope that the merger signified a spurt of maturity in the country’s politics. First, it brought South Africa closer than it had come since the end of white rule to having a meaningful opposition. The African National Congress, which propelled Mandela to the presidency in the days before its idealism withered, has lost much of its popular support by failing to pay adequate attention to the country’s enormous underclass and by tolerating corruption and ineptitude. The last time I was in South Africa, 14 months ago, it was already apparent that some of this discontent was redounding to the benefit of the Democratic Alliance, despite its reputation for being led by whites and localized in a single province, the Western Cape. In squatter camps outside Johannesburg — shanty towns named for the heroes of the A.N.C. and long strongholds of the ruling party — the Democratic Alliance was slowly building a constituency by recruiting capable local black activists who nagged town councils to deliver better services. One well-connected black leader, a longtime A.N.C. loyalist, told me back then that even without a black politician at the top, the Democratic Alliance stood to win 30 percent of the vote in 2014, which would be an impressive showing and — in South Africa’s parliamentary system — could mean real influence on national policy. There are 135 national parties registered in South Africa, but none have come this close to critical mass. Second, Ramphele’s induction into the D.A. represented the perseverance of some badly needed political grown-ups. Over the years some of the best talent of the anti-apartheid movement — and it had a deep bench — drifted from politics into business, academia or other civilian pursuits. After decades of prison, exile and struggle, it was time to make some money — and white-owned businesses were desperate to diversify their boardrooms. Ramphele, who was close to Mandela but never had much use for the authoritarian drift of the A.N.C., became vice chancellor at the University of Cape Town, a managing director of the World Bank, a director of the mighty Anglo American mining house, and one of the country’s richest women. Another example is Cyril Ramaphosa, a masterly union organizer and negotiator who was Mandela’s preferred successor as president, but was elbowed aside and instead became a business magnate. Ramaphosa has returned to the A.N.C. leadership and is likely to be the A.N.C. candidate for deputy president. Whether figures like Ramphele and Ramaphosa could reconnect with the masses has yet to be tested, but the country needs an antidote to the populists on the A.N.C.’s left flank. A talented demagogue named Julius Malema, who lived a dubiously lavish life as head of the A.N.C.’s Youth League before being expelled from the party for hate speech, has founded his own party. Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighters advocate nationalizing the country’s land, mines and banks — basically the agenda that ruined neighboring Zimbabwe. The upstart party registers barely 4 percent in the polls, but it is only a few months old, and Malema’s message has a visceral appeal in a country with nearly 25 percent unemployment and millions stranded in squalid poverty. Unless the more sober heads prevail, the A.N.C. will be tempted to veer further left in response. The third reason Ramphele stirred a bit of optimism is that she carried a message of national unity and pride that her country badly needs to hear. For all the talk of a rainbow nation, South Africa remains perilously divided. A 2012 survey found that most South Africans still identify themselves by language, ethnicity or race. They are Zulus or Xhosa, Afrikaans- or English-speakers, Indian or “colored.” Only 8.3 percent regard themselves as South Africans first — and the percentage is even lower among young people. “In America, your presidents talk about the American people,” Ramphele told me during my last visit to Johannesburg. “Here, they don’t talk about the South African people. They talk about ‘our people’ or ‘black people’ or ‘white people.’ So the sense of citizenship that is a shared thing, a common wealth, doesn’t exist.” Citizenship “is not a lived reality” and never has been, she observes. Ramphele came up in a tributary of the liberation movement known as black consciousness. Her partner and the father of her son was the charismatic black-consciousness pioneer Steve Biko, who was beaten to death in police custody in 1977. With the death or banishment of its most compelling thinkers, the philosophy of black self-reliance was eclipsed by the “non-racial” politics of the African National Congress, which was united mainly by what it opposed. Over time Ramphele’s views expanded to a philosophy she calls “human consciousness,” but the heart of it is the same: a conviction that the essential prerequisite for liberation is self-confidence and responsibility. As a teacher, she urged her black students to confront their sense of despair and impotence, the prevailing “culture of acceptance of mediocrity.” Now she urges the same on the whole country. “The authoritarian political culture that has been the legacy of this country — colonial, pre-colonial, apartheid — is very deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Africa.” In other words, what South Africa needs now is more South Africans. That wisdom does not scan as thrillingly as the warlike anthems of struggle. But Nelson Mandela, I’m quite sure, would have approved. With the collapse, probably irreparable, of last month’s compact, Ramphele has sadly become not a prophet of national unity, but a symptom of its elusiveness.",87,131,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/opinion/keller-south-africas-growing-pains.html,2014-02-17,South Africa’s Growing Pains
0,,,63,article,"The fact of a crime never changes, but the person who commits it can, and often does. This is the basic principle of parole — that while people must be punished for their wrongdoing, most are capable of growing, changing and rejoining society before the end of their sentence. But how does society determine when someone is ready to take that step? This difficult job is entrusted to parole boards, which should weigh, among other things, a person’s behavior behind bars and the likelihood that he or she will not commit another offense if released. In New York, the parole board rarely seem to consider these factors in any meaningful way, denying parole even to low-risk inmates with exemplary records in prison. Even after the state’s adoption of a new data-analysis program called Compas, to measure and predict inmates’ risk of reoffending using factors like an inmate’s education level, age when convicted and what sort of home he or she would return to, the board seems to follow the practices of an outdated era. Inmates are repeatedly denied parole long after they have served their minimum sentence, not because of misbehavior or any concern for public safety but because of the “seriousness” of the original offense. As one former chairman of the board told The New York Law Journal last year, “If the Parole Board doesn’t like the crime, you are not going to get out.” This attitude may be predictable from a body made up of political appointees, but that doesn’t make it just or protective of public safety. In 2011, legislators amended the state law to require that the board consider a prisoner’s future along with his or her past. So far it hasn’t made much of a difference. While New York has reduced its overall prison population by more than 15,000 since 2000, release rates — the board granted just over one-third of the 16,000 applications it considered in 2012 — have actually gone down. Prisoners’ rights advocates and those who have gone through the process — which involves a brief, often intimidating interview — say parole decisions are inconsistent and largely unrelated to what a person has accomplished while incarcerated. Recently, some state judges have been scrutinizing, and reversing, the board’s denials, which use boilerplate language and in some cases fail even to acknowledge an inmate’s Compas results. In December, the board finally complied with the 2011 amendment by proposing new regulations to guide its work, but it continues to resist any meaningful change. Its obstinacy is all the more lamentable because programs like Compas have been proved to work. At least 15 states have used similar data-based risk-assessment tools in recent years, with good results. A three-year study in New Jersey found that parolees were 36 percent less likely to return to prison for new crimes than inmates who served full sentences. The key was post-release supervision: parolees get it; those who “max out” do not. The study also suggested reducing the number of parolees sent back to prison for technical violations, like a missed appointment or failed drug test. In New York, such violations account for three out of four parole revocations. Lasting reform of New York’s parole system will require a fundamental reworking of both the board’s process and its culture. For low-risk inmates, early release into parole should be the default, and the board should have to articulate a good reason to keep them locked up. If the board is worried that some parolees might commit new crimes, it could start by releasing older inmates, who represent one of the fastest-growing and most-expensive segments of the prison population and yet are by far the least likely to reoffend. (Elderly prisoners convicted of first-degree murder have among the lowest recidivism rates of all.) For parole to have any value, it must serve as a meaningful incentive to personal growth and rehabilitation. “No one can ever change the past,” a prison chaplain wrote to the board last month. “But we don’t have to remain prisoners of it.”",475,329,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/opinion/new-yorks-broken-parole-system.html,2014-02-17,New York’s Broken Parole System
0,,,1492,article,"Imagine meeting someone who says she works at a university. Some years ago, it would have been fairly safe to assume that she was a professor, and a member of the middle class with enviable job security. Not anymore. Two reports make clear that the nature of the college work force has changed substantially, possibly to the detriment of educational quality. “The Just-In-Time Professor,” released last month by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, describes a growing population of more than one million adjunct and other nontenure-track instructors. “In 1970, adjuncts made up 20 percent of all higher education faculty,” the report says. “Today, they represent half.” As a rule, adjuncts have few or no benefits. They are generally paid per course, and paid poorly. (The Coalition on the Academic Workforce estimates that the median pay for a standard three-credit course is $2,700.) Because adjuncts often teach several classes in order to cobble together a living, they have little time for the research necessary to advance their careers. This increasing dependence on inexpensive adjuncts may be bad for students, as well. According to the report, students who took more courses taught by adjuncts “experienced lower graduation rates, lower grade point averages, and fewer transfers from two-year to four-year colleges, compared to other students.” The adjunct boom has been accompanied by a parallel rise in the number of college administrators. A February report from the American Institutes for Research says that between 1990 and 2012, “the average number of faculty and staff per administrator declined by roughly 40 percent in most types of four-year colleges and universities.” By 2012, there were only 2.5 instructional or “nonprofessional support” employees (like secretaries and maintenance workers) for every one administrator (like business analysts and guidance counselors). Median salaries for administrative employees ranged between $55,000 and $60,000 in fiscal year 2013 — less than tenured professors but much more than adjuncts. Colleges may well require more administrators in the 21st century than they did in the 20th. The American Institutes for Research report suggests, among other factors, a growing need for employees wholly dedicated to fund-raising as state legislators reduce support for higher education. Nevertheless, the new college campus, rife with adjuncts and administrators, does not seem geared to fulfill what is, after all, the major mission of universities: educating students.",2129,1226,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/opinion/the-new-college-campus.html,2014-02-17,The New College Campus
0,,,476,article,"North Carolina citizens have good reason to wonder just whom their environmental regulators are trying to protect. The state’s Department of Environment and Natural Resources has engaged in a series of maneuvers that seem designed to protect the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy, from paying big fines for water pollution from coal ash ponds and meeting reasonable requirements that it move toxic coal ash to lined landfills away from rivers and lakes used for drinking water and recreation. Meanwhile, the rest of the country — having heard of the damaging North Carolina coal ash spill this month — must be wondering why the federal government has yet to move against a serious pollution problem it has known about for years. One answer is the political power of the utilities. In North Carolina, a coalition of environmental groups, led by the Southern Environmental Law Center, tried three times over the past year to sue Duke Energy in federal court for violating the Clean Water Act, only to be pre-empted by the state regulatory agency, which asserted its authority to protect the public through enforcement actions in state courts. Once in control of the litigation, the state regulators quickly proposed a sweetheart settlement of suits against two Duke Energy plants. It would have imposed total fines and costs of about $99,000, a pittance for a company with operating revenues of $19.6 billion in 2012, plus a cleanup plan riddled with loopholes. Critics blamed the new Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who had worked at Duke Energy for 29 years, and the businessman he appointed to head the environmental department, John Skvarla. Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the Dan River spill and issued subpoenas for the records of Duke Energy and the environmental department. The third suit was still pending when coal ash spilled on Feb. 2 into the Dan River, near the Virginia border, through a ruptured pipe at another Duke Energy plant that is no longer in use. The state’s Department of Health and Human Services has warned people not to have contact with the water or sediment downstream and not to eat fish or shellfish from that area. On Feb. 9, The Associated Press revealed that lenient state regulators had maneuvered to block the environmental groups. The environment agency, embarrassed by the spill and the revelations, immediately asked the state judge to hold its proposed settlement in abeyance while it conducted a comprehensive review of all coal ash facilities in the state. We can only hope that this is a genuine attempt to solve the problem and not a stalling tactic. Meanwhile, Duke Energy has apologized for the big leak and pledged to make things right, but it has not committed to moving the waste to safer locations. This tawdry tale illustrates the urgent need for strong national standards for coal ash disposal, dramatized by a huge spill at a Tennessee Valley Authority facility in 2008. The federal Environmental Protection Agency proposed alternative rules in 2010. One would declare coal ash a special type of hazardous waste and give the agency authority to regulate it. The other would declare it nonhazardous and leave enforcement up to the states. The weaker option does not address “legacy” ponds that are no longer accepting new waste, like the Dan River site. The recent events in North Carolina provide ample evidence that the E.P.A., which has belatedly agreed to issue a final rule by Dec. 19, should declare coal ash a form of hazardous waste and regulate it stringently.",1272,883,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/opinion/regulatory-favoritism-in-north-carolina.html,2014-02-17,Regulatory Favoritism in North Carolina
0,paul,krugman,1703,article,"Last week’s big business news was the announcement that Comcast, a gigantic provider of cable TV and high-speed Internet service, has reached a deal to acquire Time Warner Cable, which is merely huge. If regulators approve the deal, Comcast will be an overwhelmingly dominant player in the business, with around 30 million subscribers. So let me ask two questions about the proposed deal. First, why would we even think about letting it go through? Second, when and why did we stop worrying about monopoly power? On the first question, broadband Internet and cable TV are already highly concentrated industries, with a handful of corporations accounting for most of the customers. Once upon a time antitrust authorities, looking at this situation, would probably have been trying to cut Comcast down to size. Letting it expand would have been unthinkable. Comcast’s chief executive says not to worry: “It will not reduce competition in any relevant market because our companies do not overlap or compete with each other. In fact, we do not operate in any of the same ZIP codes.” This is, however, transparently disingenuous. The big concern about making Comcast even bigger isn’t reduced competition for customers in local markets — for one thing, there’s hardly any effective competition at that level anyway. It is that Comcast would have even more power than it already does to dictate terms to the providers of content for its digital pipes — and that its ability to drive tough deals upstream would make it even harder for potential downstream rivals to challenge its local monopolies. The point is that Comcast perfectly fits the old notion of monopolists as robber barons, so-called by analogy with medieval warlords who perched in their castles overlooking the Rhine, extracting tolls from all who passed. The Time Warner deal would in effect let Comcast strengthen its fortifications, which has to be a bad idea. Interestingly, one cliché seems to be missing from the boilerplate arguments being deployed on behalf of this deal: I haven’t seen anyone arguing that the deal would promote innovation. Maybe that’s because anyone trying to make that argument would be met with snorts of derision. In fact, a number of experts — like Susan Crawford of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, whose recent book “Captive Audience” bears directly on this case — have argued that the power of giant telecommunication companies has stifled innovation, putting the United States increasingly behind other advanced countries. And there are good reasons to believe that this isn’t a story about just telecommunications, that monopoly power has become a significant drag on the U.S. economy as a whole. There used to be a bipartisan consensus in favor of tough antitrust enforcement. During the Reagan years, however, antitrust policy went into eclipse, and ever since measures of monopoly power, like the extent to which sales in any given industry are concentrated in the hands of a few big companies, have been rising fast. At first, arguments against policing monopoly power pointed to the alleged benefits of mergers in terms of economic efficiency. Later, it became common to assert that the world had changed in ways that made all those old-fashioned concerns about monopoly irrelevant. Aren’t we living in an era of global competition? Doesn’t the creative destruction of new technology constantly tear down old industry giants and create new ones? The truth, however, is that many goods and especially services aren’t subject to international competition: New Jersey families can’t subscribe to Korean broadband. Meanwhile, creative destruction has been oversold: Microsoft may be an empire in decline, but it’s still enormously profitable thanks to the monopoly position it established decades ago. Moreover, there’s good reason to believe that monopoly is itself a barrier to innovation. Ms. Crawford argues persuasively that the unchecked power of telecom giants has removed incentives for progress: why upgrade your network or provide better services when your customers have nowhere to go? And the same phenomenon may be playing an important role in holding back the economy as a whole. One puzzle about recent U.S. experience has been the disconnect between profits and investment. Profits are at a record high as a share of G.D.P., yet corporations aren’t reinvesting their returns in their businesses. Instead, they’re buying back shares, or accumulating huge piles of cash. This is exactly what you’d expect to see if a lot of those record profits represent monopoly rents. It’s time, in other words, to go back to worrying about monopoly power, which we should have been doing all along. And the first step on the road back from our grand detour on this issue is obvious: Say no to Comcast.",3125,2816,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/opinion/krugman-barons-of-broadband.html,2014-02-17,Barons of Broadband
0,tim,lahey,139,article,"HANOVER, N.H. — DESPITE the intensely personal moments that happen in hospitals, patient privacy can be elusive. Hospitals are multimillion-dollar corporations that look like shopping malls and function like factories. Doctors knock on exam room doors to signal they are about to enter — not to ask permission. The curtain that encircles the hospital bed always lets in a crack of light. Yet we do expect some degree of privacy in hospitals. We trust doctors with our secrets in part because they take a 2,000-year-old Hippocratic oath to respect our privacy, an oath enforced by laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. But sometimes, doctors have to weigh patients’ privacy against their health and safety, and that’s when things get complicated. The use of video monitoring — covert or disclosed, of patients or providers — has proliferated as high-quality, inexpensive technology has become increasingly accessible. The possibilities range from watching elderly patients at risk of falling in their rooms to recording doctors and nurses at sinks to make sure they’re washing their hands. My hospital, where I am chairman of the bioethics committee, recently wrestled with the question of where patient and family privacy ends. Nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit (N.I.C.U.) worried that a premature infant, whom I’ll call Rickie to protect his identity, was being harmed by his parents. Rickie had been released a week earlier from our hospital to a penniless couple in their early 20s whom Child Protection Services was already investigating on charges of neglecting their other children. Days later, Rickie’s mother brought him to the emergency room, telling the nurse that the baby couldn’t breathe. In the N.I.C.U., Rickie improved quickly, and a medical evaluation found no cause for his difficulty in breathing. But the next day, alerted by the squawking of an oxygen monitor, nurses and doctors ran in to find Rickie spluttering and blue. His mother was leaning over him. “See, it happened again,” she said. A pattern emerged. Each time arrangements were made for his discharge, the alarms would ring in Rickie’s room and he would be found gasping for air. Nurses noticed Rickie’s breathing problems occurred only when Rickie was alone with his mother, and never in the presence of a nurse. Concerned about child abuse, the N.I.C.U. doctor proposed mounting a small digital camera in an unobtrusive corner of Rickie’s room. “I don’t like snooping,” she said, “but we have a duty to protect that little boy.” Not everybody agreed. A senior nurse worried, “How can patients trust us if they realize we are spying on them?” Patients admitted to our hospital, like other hospitals, receive a written privacy policy stating that personal health information may be shared for medical reasons and “to report abuse or neglect to the appropriate state agencies.” Our privacy policy does not, however, warn patients about the use of video or any other specific monitoring technology. Some uses of surveillance in hospitals are clearly controversial. Nurses in a Los Angeles hospital protested in 2004 that their privacy was violated when hospital officials installed hidden security cameras, including in nursing locker rooms, after a spate of burglaries. In this case, covert videotaping did not seem justified, especially if other means of ensuring security were available. After doctors in a Veterans Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla., secretly monitored the family of a brain-damaged patient, the decision was condemned by the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Representative Jeff Miller, Republican of Florida. . He subsequently proposed legislation that would “protect the sacred trust” between providers, patients and families from covert video. Other uses of monitoring are less contentious. Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut conducts video monitoring for patients deemed at risk of falling. Nebraska Medical Center developed an unrecorded video-monitoring system for high-risk patients, such as those on suicide watch. Rhode Island Hospital was required to install recording equipment in operating rooms after multiple mistakes in surgery. And one company, Arrowsight, has developed video-auditing technology to monitor clinician hand-hygiene practices at sinks and safety and cleanliness in operating rooms. These all seem like thoughtful uses. Protecting children is a well-established justification for video surveillance. In a 2000 study, Georgia physicians reported that covert video monitoring diagnosed far more cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy — in which parents fake illness in their children — than usual diagnostic testing. At my hospital, the ethics team decided it would be acceptable to secretly monitor Rickie’s room if other methods, like confronting the parents, failed to ensure Rickie’s safety. A few days later, Rickie’s mother confessed to neglect, and to holding a pillow over his face to keep him from returning home. We never had to videotape Rickie’s room, and he now awaits placement in a safer home. Hidden cameras should be a last resort. Hospitals should notify patients that covert video monitoring may be used in unusual circumstances, and only with the oversight of a hospital ethics committee. Institutions should then track the use of covert video monitoring to ensure that it remains rare and appropriate, while letting hospitals marshal technology to protect our most vulnerable patients.",249,351,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/opinion/a-watchful-eye-in-hospitals.html,2014-02-17,A Watchful Eye in Hospitals
0,robert,ross,124,article,"LAST month, Maryland became one of the first states to tackle the widespread injustice of overly harsh discipline policies in our schools, adopting regulations that require an end to practices that have doubled the number of out-of-school suspensions for African-American students in the past decade. The new regulations came just three weeks after Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. warned school districts that a continuation of the large disparities in suspension and expulsion rates constituted a possible civil rights violation and could trigger a federal investigation. But too many schools still use severe and ineffective practices to address student misbehavior. Large numbers of students are kicked out, typically for nonviolent offenses, and suspensions have become the go-to response for even minor misbehavior, like carrying a plastic water gun to elementary school or sometimes simply for talking back. The Civil Rights Project at U.C.L.A. found that the number of secondary school students suspended or expelled increased by some 40 percent between 1972-73 and 2009-10. Rather than teaching kids a lesson, these practices increase dropout rates and arrest rates — with severe social and economic consequences. They also disproportionately affect students of color and students with learning disabilities. A study of nearly one million Texas students found that those suspended or expelled for violations at the discretion of school officials were almost three times as likely to be in contact with the juvenile justice system the following year. But these patterns can be reversed, in innovative school districts and with help from teachers’ unions. We’ve seen it happen in California and Maryland, where our foundations have helped officials to change discipline policies and lower suspension rates. In the San Francisco Bay Area, Richmond High School saw suspensions drop by 47 percent over three years when it adopted a practice, “restorative justice,” which brings together all involved parties to discuss what happened and why, and to develop a way to make amends. At Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, teachers and administrators saw reinvigorated student governance, brought parents into the school as extra hands and eyes for critical parts of the day, and instituted after-school detention, drug counseling and conflict-resolution training. Suspensions plummeted, from 510 in 2008-9 to just 2 in the last two years. The result of these and other discipline reforms in California was a 14 percent drop in suspensions and a 12 percent decrease in expulsions for the 2012-13 school year. Similarly, in Baltimore, local activists worked with the school district to revise its code of conduct. The new code included graduated consequences that increased with the age of the child, incidents of misbehavior and the nature of the offense. Baltimore schools have instituted other alternative programs, and administrators have been trained to routinely check to make sure that non-classroom areas, including the bus stop outside, are safe. Smart thinking about the lives students lead has also helped head off misbehavior. One principal of a Baltimore school with a dress code installed a washer and dryer in the building so that students without access to laundries could be assured of having clean khakis and button-down shirts, and not avoid school. The result of these reforms has been a dramatic reduction in total suspensions in Baltimore schools (8,620 in 2012-13, down from 16,739 in 2006-7). Dropout rates for African-American boys decreased by 59 percent; graduation rates for that group increased by 16 percent. Improving school climates lessens the need for suspensions and expulsions and creates an atmosphere more conducive to learning. Education, law-enforcement and government leaders should follow the example of Richmond, Calif., Baltimore and other cities, like Denver, where the public schools and the police department negotiated an agreement defining what police officers in schools can and can’t do, and Los Angeles, which has banned suspensions for “willful defiance.” They should look to groups like the Chicago Teachers Union, which has consistently pushed for positive alternatives to overly harsh discipline policies. Ultimately, full-scale change requires giving teachers the tools and resources to effectively manage their classrooms. It also means ensuring that students are not victims of the kind of stereotyping or racial bias that results in unfair punishments. As a nation, we need to embrace the reforms, both large and small, that keep students in school learning rather than out of school misbehaving.",754,531,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/opinion/real-discipline-in-school.html,2014-02-17,Real Discipline in School
0,lee,billings,67,article,"Just over 45 years ago, midway on their journey to the Moon, the astronauts of Apollo 8 looked back at the Earth and became the first humans in history to see our world wholly in the round, whirling through the void. The Earth was so shrunken by distance, the astronaut Jim Lovell noted, that he could cover it with an outstretched thumb. Looking at the small disk of white, brown and royal blue far below, he grew pensive. “What I keep imagining is, if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about Earth at this altitude, whether I’d think it would be inhabited or not,” Mr. Lovell mused. He saw no obvious signs of life or civilization, and wondered whether an outsider would even recognize the blue as ocean and the brown as land. In lunar orbit on Christmas Eve, the Apollo 8 crew read the creation story from Genesis, and snapped pictures of the Earth rising like a fragile jewel above the Moon’s monochrome craters. The photographs awakened something long slumbering within all who saw them, a greater sense of worth for our world and all its wonders. Among those who sent Apollo on its lunar voyage, it had become fashionable to believe our species and our planet were unremarkable footnotes in an indifferent and pointless universe. Yet glimpsed from a spacecraft orbiting the Moon, alive and alone in the endless dark, the Earth was revealed without question as the most precious and significant object in the solar system, having birthed beings to behold such an expansive view. The crew of Apollo 8 had set out to visit the Moon but rediscovered the Earth and some fraction of our faded glory. Today, we are poised for another epochal discovery, one that could once again transform our perceptions of our place in creation. We are on the verge of taking world-changing pictures — not of our Earth, but of other planets that might be like it, far beyond our solar system. These planets would first appear just as sparkling glints in images from a telescope, but we could still study them for signs of habitability and life. Even reduced to a pointlike dot, a planet’s surface can be crudely mapped by fluctuations in its brightness, as light-absorbing oceans or highly reflective continents periodically spin into view. By measuring how light interacts with molecules in a planet’s atmosphere, a world can be surveyed for “biosignature” gases such as oxygen and methane, allowing scientists to sniff out the breath of life at interstellar distances. For the past 20 years, astronomers have been conducting a galactic planetary census of the Milky Way. So far they have found more than a thousand planets, and evidence for hundreds of billions more. Because even the biggest, brightest planets are still much smaller and fainter than their stars, most of these newly discovered worlds have revealed themselves not in photographs, but via indirect ways involving the wobbling or dimming of their parent stars. Most of the planets now known seem to be quite unlike the Earth. But the more carefully they look, the more astronomers are finding many smaller, more Earth-like “Goldilocks” worlds. A Goldilocks world is not too big, causing it to be smothered beneath thick layers of gas. It is not too small, so that its atmosphere drifts away. It is neither scorchingly close nor frigidly far from its star, which, like our Sun, is sedately middle-aged and midsized. Instead, a Goldilocks world resides where temperatures could be just right for liquid water, the cornerstone of life. Statistics suggest that such a planet exists within a dozen light-years of us. Will any of the Goldilocks worlds have oceans and continents, seasons and moonlight? Will they have plants and animals, cities and machines? Will mirror Earths prove common as dirt, or could our world and each of our lives upon it turn out to be more precious than most have dared to dream? Unless we strive to actually see those promising planets, we will have scant hope of answering these questions. The challenges to photographing a mirror Earth are daunting, but not insurmountable. A small rocky planet is a dim mote of dust lost in the glare from a thermonuclear fireball we call a star. For every photon of planetary light that goes into making a picture, 10 billion stellar photons must first be filtered out; remarkably, researchers have already devised several ways to do this. All that the planet-hunters really need to find the mirror Earths is a big mirror, high above the Earth’s blurring atmosphere — a space telescope large enough to gather the faint light of Goldilocks worlds around a sizable sample of stars. Such a powerful telescope would broadly benefit all of astronomy and cosmology, and its technological development would be invaluable for commercial and defense applications requiring large, lightweight structures deployed in space. Alas, as presently conceived, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope falls short of what is needed, and the world’s underfunded, overburdened space agencies have neither the mandate nor commitment to build anything else remotely suitable. Worse, the space science community is divided. Some space scientists who do not study planets are fearful that their own research specialties will be overshadowed by the glamorous search for Goldilocks worlds. They would not mourn the stillbirth of any ambitious life-finding telescope, no matter how much such projects may be desired by the taxpaying public. If this cynical faction has its way, as the list of Goldilocks worlds around nearby stars grows long in the years to come, those planets shall be silently passed over to remain unexplored. The prospect of shattering or substantiating our cosmic solitude could slip through our fingers. In that future, anyone could point to stars harboring what could be mirror Earths, but each twinkling point of light would only mock us with the sight of what we might have known. We must decide which future we want. The time has come to look into our mirrors.

0,mustafa,akyol,99,article,"Over the past decade, the Turkish government has received much praise for successfully melding Islam and democracy. Today, however, Ankara’s continued reliance on tactics of confrontation and intimidation is threatening to overshadow the country’s significant achievements. As Turkey attempts to construct a post-revolutionary order, it would do well to follow the example of one Arab country that has managed to avoid political gridlock: Tunisia. In 2011, protests led to the ouster of Tunisia’s longtime dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. The spirit of revolution soon spread to other Arab countries, albeit with less-impressive results. Libya suffered from bloody internal turmoil; Egypt reverted to brutal military rule; Syria continues to be ravaged by civil war. In Tunisia, however, the nascent democratic process has not been derailed. The country’s new Constitution — the most liberal and democratic charter the Muslim Middle East has ever seen — remains the Arab Spring’s crowning achievement to date. Ratified on Jan. 26, the Constitution is a strikingly “We the people” document in a region where “Me the state” has long been the norm. It protects civil liberties, establishes a separation of powers, and guarantees women parity in political bodies. Though it declares Islam the country’s official religion and refers generally to Tunisia’s identity as an Islamic state, the Constitution protects religious freedom for all. This is a significant achievement, as things might have easily gone awry. Like most other countries in the region, Tunisia is deeply divided along secular and religious lines. The post-revolutionary ascendance of the Islamist Ennahda party has particularly troubled the secularists. In May 2012, ultraconservatives in Jendouba and Sidi Bouzid firebombed bars and stores selling alcohol; the following month, Salafists in a Tunis suburb rioted in protest of an art exhibit they considered insulting to Muslims. The violence soon spread to other areas around the capital. These and other repeated provocations by hard-line Salafist groups, including the assassination in 2013 of two prominent liberal politicians, Mohamed Brahmi and Chokri Belaid, have caused some to fear an Egyptian-style military coup against elected Islamists. Thus far, at least, reason has prevailed and Tunisians have been able to reach consensus. Ennahda, widely recognized as the most moderate of all Arab Islamist parties, has shown a remarkable capacity for compromise. Under the leadership of the liberal-leaning Islamic thinker Rachid al-Ghannouchi, Ennahda has stepped back from its earlier goal of establishing Tunisia as an Islamic state and enforcing Shariah law. Secularists saw this concession not as a sign of weakness (and an opportune moment for attack), but as a token of goodwill; the resulting sense of national unity gave rise to the new Constitution. I have been following the steady stream of good news out of Tunisia with admiration, if not envy. Paradoxically, Turkey’s democracy, which is more than six decades old, and its economy, the world’s 17th largest in 2012, are better-established and stronger than Tunisia’s. But Turkey sorely lacks the consensus-making skills that Tunisians so clearly possess. Turkish politics is poisoned by bitter fighting between leaders who view compromise as cowardice. Quarreling political figures condemn one another for “high treason,” and often resort to extravagant conspiracy theories to delegitimize opponents. The result is that confrontation is common, and agreement all too rare. This is why Turkey, still governed by a 1982 military Constitution, has not been able to pass a liberal democratic charter like Tunisia’s. Military dominance has gradually eased in the past decade, but elected politicians have proven unable to agree on what a new document would look like. A parliamentary constitution-drafting committee was established in 2011 following general elections that saw the re-election of Mr. Erdogan to a third term. (Indeed, the passage of a new constitution had been one of Mr. Erdogan’s main campaign pledges.) But the initiative was declared dead last December, largely because Mr. Erdogan’s governing Justice and Development Party insisted on a regime that maximized presidential power at the expense of the legislature and judiciary, and incorporated few checks and balances. Turkey’s main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, proved similarly rigid. In late January, the passage of Tunisia’s Constitution was celebrated in that country’s National Constituent Assembly by deputies from all parties, who hugged one another, sang and chanted “Mabrouk alina,” or “Congratulations to us all.” Just days earlier, a markedly different scene played out in the Turkish Parliament, as vicious debates devolved into a full-fledged fist fight that left one member injured. It was the second time punches had been thrown in the Turkish Parliament that month. (In the earlier incident, a deputy had thrown an iPad, too.) Ultimately, the problem is not that one or another opposing faction is too religious, too secular, or too ideological; it is that everyone is too macho and power-hungry. Today, Turkey is a nation of rapid economic growth, declining inequality and heightened political participation. One of the world’s top tourist destinations, it has invested heavily in infrastructure and public transportation. Turks do not need more high rises or shopping malls; we already have plenty of those. What we urgently need to build is a culture of dialogue, empathy and consensus — and Tunisia might be a good place to look for guidance.

0,seth,siegel,192,article,"Nuclear proliferation, religious militancy and income inequality are all major threats to Middle East stability. Sadly, a new one is brewing: water scarcity. The human causes are clear: rapid population growth, antiquated infrastructure, the over-pumping of aquifers, inefficient crop practices and pollution from fertilizer and pesticides. Then there are the factors that climate change is accelerating, like evaporation of lakes and rivers and diminished rainfall. One country in the region might have a solution to these water woes: Israel. It shares the same problems of climate and desertification as its neighbors, but it has mastered the management of water resources, such that it can endure periodic droughts while supporting a growing population. Its water management can not only be a model but can even reduce regional tensions. Wasteful farming practices — in particular, flooding a field to irrigate it — are the biggest factor behind the regional water shortage. Starting in the 1960s, Israeli farmers abandoned this technique in favor of drip irrigation, which reduces the loss of water to evaporation, gets water to roots more efficiently and, critically, produces crop yields vastly greater than those with conventional irrigation. Israel also treats household sewage as a precious resource, reusing more than 80 percent of it for agriculture. In Iran and many Arab countries, sewage is dumped, which can threaten public health by contaminating wells and aquifers. There is precedent for Israel’s helping its neighbors with water. Before 1979 —around the time it began to adopt technologies and policies that led to its current water abundance — Israel was Iran’s partner in developing its national water resources. That cooperation began in 1962, after a severe earthquake in the Qazvin region of Iran killed more than 12,000 people. The earthquake collapsed a chain of wells that engineers had drilled in a qanat, or tunnel, style. Hundreds of thousands were at risk from lack of drinking water. Israel flew in teams of drillers. New water supplies were identified, and a series of artesian wells were drilled. The drilling was such a success that Israel’s water engineering company, today a private enterprise, was hired to identify and gain access to underground resources elsewhere in Iran. Beginning in 1968, a desalination company owned by the Israeli government built dozens of plants in Iran. These are now aging, while Israel continues to innovate: On its Mediterranean coast, it recently opened an immense, energy-efficient desalination plant. More than half of Israel’s drinking water — purer, cleaner and less salty than natural sources — now comes from seawater. Cooperation with Iran abruptly ended with the Islamic revolution. Indeed, the Israeli team of water experts was on one of the last direct flights from Iran to Israel in 1979. Wars over water have been forecast as a coming threat worldwide, and the geopolitical risks can’t be discounted. Syria, ruined by civil war, and Iraq, still an epicenter of religious violence, will suffer even more, as Turkey accelerates its diversion of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to make up for its shortsighted over-pumping of once-massive Anatolian aquifers. Egypt, with 10 times Israel’s population but nearly 50 times the water available, uses water inefficiently, despite the age-old centrality of agriculture to its economy. Ethiopia, upriver to Sudan and Egypt, is asserting water rights to the Nile for its growing population, putting it in tension with Egypt. Yemen might be in the worst shape: Short of immediate, radical steps, it could be out of water in 15 years. Because of geography and hydrology, the Palestinians’ water future is closely tied to Israel’s. In just the few years of Hamas control of Gaza, the water supply there has been polluted, and though no solution to its coming water crisis is likely without an Israeli role, Hamas has refused to cooperate with Israel. The Palestinians in the West Bank already receive much of their water from Israel’s national water utility and, sovereignty and symbolism aside, neither a two-state solution nor a continuation of the status quo will change that. Given their proximity to Israel, the Palestinians are likely to be among the few Arab winners in the water race. Israel’s self-sufficiency in water goes beyond irrigation, drilling, desalination and reclaimed water. It is also dependent on a sophisticated legal and regulatory structure, market mechanisms, robust public education, an obsession with fixing leaks and efforts to catch rainwater and reduce evaporation, among many other tools. Natural plant-breeding methods have raised crop yields with salty, high-mineral brackish water of the kind found, but mostly thought of as worthless, all over the Middle East. Israel has transformed water from a struggle with nature to an economic input: You can get all you want if you plan and pay for it. No one should wish for a water crisis anywhere. But as water problems grow, one hopes that ideology will give way to pragmatism and may open a door to an Arab and Islamic outreach to Israel. A partnership that starts with engineers and extends to farmers could contribute to deal making, even reconciliation, among leaders. Rather than seeing Israel as a problem, Israel’s antagonists would be wise to see it as a solution.

0,frank,bruni,77,article,"AN idea for the Senate: brown paper bags. You know, the kind in which you cut little holes for your eyes and your nose and a bigger, wider hole for your mouth. Senators could wear these in the chamber, so that the C-Span cameras and the outside world wouldn’t know precisely who’s supporting what. Or maybe ski masks, though those wreak havoc on hairdos. Alternately, the lawmakers could communicate in code: anything to obscure their actions and make it easier for them to actually cast votes in line with their best judgment and consciences. Oh, you thought they always did that? Well then I won’t spill the beans on Santa or the Easter bunny, either. Last week was a doozy, and not in the usual way. The nation didn’t lurch toward another cliff; the suffixes -geddon and -pocalypse didn’t come out to play; the air didn’t grow thick with dire “s” words like stalemate, standoff and the direst of all, shutdown. No, last week ended with Congress’s having steered clear of disaster by passing a measure to lift the debt ceiling. Congress functioned, more or less. And yet — here’s the clincher — it looked as ugly as usual, if not uglier. At issue was the way it functioned, a dysfunction of its own. Over in the House, Republican leaders brought the lifting of the debt ceiling to a vote so that they and a smattering of their party colleagues could pass the measure with the help of nearly all of the Democrats. You might naïvely wonder how this wouldn’t estrange the leaders from their caucus. But you’d be failing to take into account that many members of that caucus wanted the measure to succeed, recognizing that this was in the nation’s interest, but wanted at the same time to vote no, so as not to draw attacks from party extremists. In Congress, this isn’t considered a contradiction. It’s not even considered undignified. It’s considered canny self-preservation. (You serve, above all, to get re-elected.) The phenomenon is common enough that in a recent story in The Times, my colleagues Ashley Parker and Jonathan Weisman assigned it a name: Vote No, Hope Yes. In a given chamber of Congress, the majority party usually takes responsibility for raising the debt ceiling, while the minority is permitted to balk and rail theatrically about wanton government spending. In fact Barack Obama did such balking and railing when he was in the Democratic minority of the Senate. Now Democrats run the show there, and they were poised to provide the necessary support to get the ceiling lifted. But the inimitable and irrepressible Ted Cruz insisted on a 60-vote threshold to allow the measure to be taken up, and getting past this hurdle required at least five Republicans to side with Democrats. If the Republicans in the Senate had really cared to doom the measure, this was their big chance. But their true and ardent desire was to appear adamantly opposed without being so, and thus to appease party loudmouths without actually letting those loudmouths get their way. This was where the brown paper bags would have come in very handy, because to avoid a filibuster and let the measure ultimately succeed, some Republicans had to step up and actually cast a vote in favor of its consideration. Their solution: to conduct this first, procedural vote in silence — an extremely rare and exceedingly curious thing — so that it wasn’t immediately clear to observers which Republicans were effectively helping to make sure the debt ceiling got raised. The theory, presumably, was that by the time it did become clear, those same Republicans would have proceeded to cast a subsequent “no” vote against the raise itself, whose passage required only the simple majority of votes that Democrats alone could provide.  The world’s greatest deliberative body at work! Make sure the children are watching! Inspiring civic lessons for all! This isn’t just about the debt ceiling. On too many other fronts, the gulf between how lawmakers know they should behave and what they have the political courage to do is painfully wide. This has happened with Hurricane Sandy relief, with the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, with budgetary matters. The week before last, immigration reform fell apart, and not because of the number of lawmakers who think it’s a horrid idea, but because of the number who think it’s probably a good idea but don’t want to commit to that and confront any blowback. And last week the Senate, in a 95-3 vote, and the House, by a 326-90 margin, reversed a portion of a budget agreement that would have limited cost-of-living increases in many military veterans’ pensions to 1 percent below the rate of inflation. Bob Kerrey, a former Democratic senator and a veteran, told me that the limit, which the Pentagon endorsed, was utterly reasonable and absolutely necessary, and he assured me that most lawmakers knew this. But they worried that if they stood by that conviction, veterans groups would succeed in branding them enemies of the nation’s heroes. “It’s all about inoculating yourself against the sound bite,” he said. “And now it’s more than a sound bite. It’s also what’s trending on Twitter.” Most lawmakers, he added, believe that the failure to rein in Medicare and Social Security represents a serious threat to the country’s future, but they’re too politically timid to reflect that in their votes. SUCH cowardice and self-interest aren’t new. But certain wrinkles are. Kerrey mentioned Twitter and, indeed, complaints and catcalls circulate with unprecedented efficiency and reach. It’s quicker for interest groups and opponents to fasten targets on lawmakers’ backs. It’s easier to rouse the rabble. “With the ability to use computers, it’s worsened,” Mike Castle, a Delaware Republican who served in the House for nearly two decades, said. He added that websites and social media, not to mention cable TV and talk radio, have turned the political atmosphere more broadly and instantaneously caustic. “You have that constant carping. It has made Congress a more difficult place to achieve the greater good.” Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, noted that in the past, some votes in Congress wouldn’t even be recorded by individual lawmakers’ names. There was also more hidden back-room dealing. “That kind of insularity allowed legislators to take positions that might not be politically great but were the right thing to do,” he said. I asked Kerrey: Do the politicians who frequently buck their own consciences at least feel misgivings about that? Struggle with it? “Now you’re presuming that they’re in contact with their consciences on a regular basis,” he said. “I haven’t actually met many human beings who are. That’s a tough transaction: looking out for your conscience.”",181,245,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/bruni-let-our-lawmakers-hide.html,2014-02-16,Let Our Lawmakers Hide!
0,marcus,samuelsson,1439,article,"WHEN I was walking to work one day last summer, I noticed that Crab Man Mike was gone from his usual post at 125th Street and Fifth Avenue. Mike has been cooking shellfish in his special pot on the streets of Harlem for 23 years. Concerned, I began asking the other street vendors where he went. Johnny Portland, one of the Jamaican guys who also sets up some days at 125th and Fifth, told me Crab Mike had moved. I found him a few blocks farther uptown — 132nd Street and Seventh Avenue, where he had set up his pot in front of Doug E.’s Fresh Chicken and Waffles. He was serving up shellfish to his neighbors and friends. When I asked him why he switched locations, he told me it was because he could no longer recognize his customers at 125th and Fifth. There were too many crowds, too many new faces and businesses. He may have made more sales there, but on this quieter corner he felt more comfortable. The people he served here were people he had known for years. He knew their families, their troubles, their joys. This is what was more important to him as a cook — being a part of his customers’ lives. I was struck by this decision. To me it resonated with one of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned from living in Harlem for the last 10 years and operating a restaurant here — Red Rooster Harlem — for three: a culture of hospitality. When I first started coming to Harlem, it was the late 1990s. I had just moved to New York from France to work at Aquavit, and I had the typical nomadic life of the recent New York transplant. I lived with multiple roommates and moved every few months, searching for a foothold and a place that felt like home. I lived in the East Village and then Hell’s Kitchen, neither too far from the restaurant, where I worked long shifts. When I needed to unwind after work, I always found myself taking the subway uptown. I’d take a corner seat at Sylvia’s. Also, the lounge annex of Sylvia’s restaurant, where the chef Melba Wilson worked at the time. “Hi, Sugar,” she would say when she walked up to my table. After a long day running a three-star kitchen where we served from the left, cleared from the right, and could make or break our careers on how we julienned vegetables, I found her warmth disarming. I would order a beer, listen to jazz, hip-hop and poetry — and relax. For so long Harlem had just been an idea to me, found in books and music when growing up in Sweden and then working in France. It was Langston Hughes and Miles Davis, the Apollo and the Y, and Malcolm X sitting in a dark corner of Small’s Paradise. It was the center of black culture, the center of cool, a place so remote to me in Europe that I could hardly imagine it. Now I was here, feeling it. Those nights were some of the first times in my life when I wasn’t a minority in the room. I’d eat a dinner of soul food at Miss Mamie’s Spoonbread Too, where Norma Jean Darden cooked her mother’s recipes, and then wander the neighborhood. I’d browse the old bookshops and street vendors, surrounded by people from all over the world: Ghana and Senegal, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. Students marched for equal rights, civil-rights activists passed out leaflets, and old native Harlemites fund-raised for churches and schools. There were hardships on the street, poverty and violence at times, but everyone had flair, style and pride. I found movement in the hustle on 125th Street — a sense of excitement and possibility. Everywhere I went in Harlem I felt welcome. I began to recognize a kind of hospitality that I hadn’t known before and that I hadn’t found in fine dining. In the Michelin restaurants in France where I trained early in my career, I was taught excellence in ingredients, presentation and manners. But I wasn’t taught the joy and magic I felt walking into the bars and soul food joints in Harlem. It’s this feeling that I most want to convey when asked about Harlem now. Business isn’t just about food and drink, it’s about restoring and sustaining a community that is changing quickly. In the local bars, like Paris Blues, my favorite jazz haunt, there are often crockpots of free food set up in the corner for anyone who’s hungry. At Just Lorraine’s Place on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, near 132nd Street, under a dusty portrait of Thelonious Monk, a poster announces the celebration of a woman’s birthday, with well wishes scrawled in marker next to her portrait. When I stopped by A Touch of Dee on Lenox Avenue at 143rd Street last November, a sign let me know that Corinne was serving that night and a poster announced that Mrs. Dee herself would host a free Thanksgiving dinner. At Showmans Jazz Club, there’s never a cover to hear incredible jazz and R&B, and appetizers and snacks are often free at the bar. These are the places I go to relax, where I can leave my busy life at the door and speak to my neighbors for a while. RIGHT now, Harlem is on the verge. Since 2010, there’s been a restaurant boom. Dick Parsons has opened The Cecil in the ground floor of the old Cecil Hotel. The Grange on Amsterdam Avenue at 141st Street features signature cocktails and seasonal local produce on its menu. Bier International, a beer garden with a brilliantly curated range of brews, and the speakeasy 67 Orange have become popular nightspots. To a community with 19 percent unemployment, these places bring hundreds of jobs that can’t be outsourced. They don’t just offer cooking and serving positions, but jobs for artists and musicians, lighting and sound engineers, handymen and electricians. Now people are coming uptown for a night out. I travel all over the world for work and I am constantly asked to define Harlem. What’s it like, people ask. Is it cool? Is it safe? When I go to places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to speak among celebrated thinkers and leaders, I’m often asked: Is Harlem good now? I always have to pause before answering. Good compared with what? To when? These questions all miss the mark. Is Harlem good now? That is a question loaded with long-held ideas about race and class, one that dismisses the complex, vital history of this neighborhood and its people, their contributions to civil rights and art, under one word: “bad.” Good or bad doesn’t begin to describe this neighborhood I love. The beauty of Harlem is that it isn’t definable as one thing or another. It has always been a place for the strivers: immigrants of all races and nationalities, artists and musicians and entrepreneurs. People have sought refuge here and have felt the need to seek refuge from here. It’s been brought to its knees by poverty and drugs and unemployment and has been pulled up by its art, its music, its food and its people. After talking to Crab Man Mike that day on the street, I invited him to host a summer crab fest as guest chef at Red Rooster. Like any great chef, he brought his own equipment — his magic pot — and he cooked up delicious fresh crabs and clams from the Hunts Point Market, seasoned with his secret spice blend. It was one of the most memorable nights we’ve had at the Rooster. Living and working here and walking these streets, I have learned a new sense of hospitality from Harlem. It’s the feeling that lets me know I’m home.",4731,1987,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/is-harlem-good-now.html,2014-02-16,Is Harlem ‘Good’ Now?

0,jennifer,boylan,211,article,"BELGRADE LAKES, Me. — THERE’S a scene in the new Amazon show “Transparent” when the family patriarch, Mort, walks in on his oldest daughter in flagrante with her lesbian lover. The character, who’s been struggling throughout the pilot with how to come out as trans, stands there in drag with a bemused expression. “Hello, ladies,” Mort — now Maura — says. When I was first asked to serve as an adviser to the show, I hesitated, fearing that it would get the issues all wrong, as television and film often do where transgender characters are concerned. And yet I was won over by the pilot’s charm. So far, anyway, “Transparent,” written and directed by Jill Soloway, shows every sign of being one of the first television shows to depict the life of its transgender heroine with grace and respect. Of the 10 pilots released early this month as part of Amazon’s gambit to enter the content-streaming market, “Transparent” is the breakout hit. A reviewer in the culture blog Vulture called it “my favorite pilot in years, and by a lot.” She continued, “the thesis of the show” is that “we hide some things and disclose other things but maybe not as well as we think we do. (Or maybe, accidentally, too well.)” The only problem? The actor playing Maura, Jeffrey Tambor, is neither female nor trans. One might think that this is not much of an issue; stepping into other people’s skins is, after all, what actors do. But there are plenty of talented transgender actresses in Hollywood, including, of course, the amazing Laverne Cox, currently burning it up in “Orange is the New Black.” There are others as well; Calpernia Addams and Candis Cayne come to mind, although, admittedly, they aren’t old enough to play the part of Maura. But you can understand why trans viewers might grow weary of seeing themselves constantly portrayed by straight actors for whom trans roles are an opportunity to “stretch themselves.” Why do these parts go to people who struggle to imitate us, when there are trans actors ready and able to bring to these roles the authority and authenticity of their own lives? Jared Leto’s casting in “Dallas Buyers Club,” for instance, has been met with a sense of exhaustion by some parts of the trans community. In the wake of Mr. Leto’s Golden Globe for his portrayal of the character Rayon, the trans activist Jen Richards wrote, “That’s it. I’m going to write movies with entirely trans casts. Even the cis” — or non-transgender — “characters will be played by trans people. And then we’ll have our own awards ceremony and lavish them with awards for their brave portrayals.” Despite this recent blowback, there’s been some evidence that the entertainment and media industries are slowly coming to grips with the harmful effects of clichéd portrayals of trans women as victims or villains. There were Carmen Carrera and Ms. Cox on Katie Couric’s program in January, pushing back against the meme that every trans person’s biological history is somehow public property; there was ESPN’s Christina Kahrl writing in Grantland about that magazine’s blithe outing of a trans woman in the article “Dr. V’s Magical Putter,” which was inevitably implicated in its subject’s suicide a few months before publication. Then there was Janet Mock, author of the book “Redefining Realness,” on the Piers Morgan program early this month, trying to explain that the on-screen headline, “Was a boy until age 18” was problematic, particularly in the way it defined gender through genitalia alone. I thought her response to Mr. Morgan was poised and articulate: “I was born a baby,” Ms. Mock said. “As soon as I had enough agency in my own life to grow up, I became who I am.” It’s clear that the terrain is changing. After serving as consigliere to the writers creating “Transparent,” I can affirm that their desire to create a show that is respectful and representative of trans experience is genuine. They asked me lots of difficult questions, and I tried to answer. (What was it like to cross dress, back before my transition? My answer: It was like Beatles heaven. You know that moment in “Day in the Life” when Paul sings, “Somebody spoke, and I went into a dream,” and John sings the word “Ahhh” for the next 12 bars? It was like that.) I’m sympathetic to Ms. Soloway, the director. She has had to take some pains to justify the casting of Mr. Tambor, who, let’s face it, is no Janet Mock, a woman who, in addition to being a good writer, happens to also be drop-dead gorgeous. Many viewers will find it hard to see Mr. Tambor as more than a “man in a dress.” But not every trans female who comes out is going to be instantly seen as the woman she knows herself to be, in spite of what is in her heart. And it’s this, I think, that justifies the casting of Mr. Tambor in this instance, and that makes the quandary of the character so deeply moving. That “Transparent” depicts a schlumpy, older person rather than a gorgeous fashion model is good for both trans and cis folks alike. It captures the surprisingly universal problem of being defined only by our biology, rather than our spirits. It should make us stop and think about what it means to be a man, or a woman, and the struggle that so many people face in trying to live our truth. This isn’t a problem unique to transgender people; it’s the same for all of us. I remember my days of struggling to “pass” in the world. Once, I went to L. L. Bean, in Freeport, Me., to buy some jeans. It wasn’t a good gender day, and other shoppers kept casting glances at me with mingled shock and dismay. In the afternoon, a mother holding her child’s hand walked toward me, and the boy’s eyes grew wide. “Mom,” he said, in a voice of astonishment, as they passed me. “Who was that?” I am still grateful for the mother’s reply. “That,” she said, “was a human being.”",709,371,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/boylan-transgender-schlumpy-and-human.html,2014-02-16,"Transgender, Schlumpy and Human"
0,ross,douthat,1297,article,"WHEN I became a father, I expected to change in all the predictable ways — to become more responsible and more exhausted, to lose contact with friends and lean more heavily on relatives, to grow steadily balder of head and softer of belly. What I didn’t expect is that parenthood would make me such a whiner. I’m not sure I’ve contributed personally to the Internet’s ever-expanding Book of Parental Lamentations — what Ruth Graham, writing for Slate, calls the “endless stream of blog posts and status updates depicting the messy, tedious, nightmarishly life-destroying aspects of parenting.” But in private conversation, I’m often the sort of parent Graham complains is scaring her away from motherhood — all too eager to Tell It Like It Really Is, and enumerate all the horrible aspects of the most wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me. Coming from the financially secure and happily married, this whining can feel unseemly, self-indulgent and unfair to one’s kids. In my own case, it’s also philosophically problematic, since a Catholic columnist should presumably be trying to talk his acquaintances into having as many kids as possible. But a not-so-quiet desperation can seem pervasive among parents, and it’s worth trying to understand why. Fortunately, Jennifer Senior’s new book, “All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood,” is an excellent primer on possible explanations for the great parental pity party. It ranges across the problems with family policy in the United States (basically, we don’t have one), the changing role of children (who went, she notes, “from being our employees to our bosses”), the unsettling of gender roles, the “having it all” stresses inherent in the maternal quest for work-life balance, and the way economic uncertainty and technological change make it hard for parents to figure out what kind of world they’re supposed to be preparing their children for. But Senior’s most insightful emphasis, I think, is on the gap that’s opened — thanks to our society’s extraordinary wealth and libertarian social ethic — between the lifestyles and choices available to nonparents and the irreducible burdens still involved in raising children. As she puts it, parenthood is “the last binding obligation in a culture that asks for almost no other permanent commitments at all.” In this sense, it isn’t necessarily that family life has changed that dramatically in the last few generations. Rather, it’s stayed the same in crucial ways — because babies still need what babies need — while outside the domestic sphere there’s been an expansion of opportunities, a proliferation of choices and entertainments and immediately available gratifications, that make child rearing seem much more burdensome by comparison. This has two consequences for young, reasonably affluent Americans. First, it creates an understandable reluctance to give up the pleasures of extended brunches and long happy hours, late nights and weekend getaways, endless hours playing Grand Theft Auto or binge-watching “New Girl.” Second, it inspires a ferocious shock when a child arrives and that oh-so-modern lifestyle gives way to challenges that seem almost medieval, and duties that seem impossibly absolute. And the longer the arrival is delayed, the greater that shock — because “postponing children,” Senior points out, can make parents “far more aware of the freedoms they’re giving up.” “Welcome,” a colleague emailed me after our first daughter was born, “to unavoidable reality.” Which is exactly right: In parts of American society, death and children’s diapers are the only unavoidable realities left. Unless, of course, you avoid the diapers by avoiding the children altogether, as the developed world’s inhabitants are increasingly inclined to do. In an earlier column, I described this retreat from childbearing as (in part) a symptom of cultural decadence, in which modern comforts crowd out intergenerational obligations. This idea was not well received by many readers, but I think it’s actually the unacknowledged worldview behind a lot of the parental griping you find online and elsewhere: The “look how impossible my life has become since I had kids” genre is a way of passing judgment, not all that subtly, on people who have opted out of the parental mission altogether. And though I agree with the implicit message — that parenting is tough, necessary and praiseworthy — a brag disguised as a whine about your own un-decadent hardships is probably not the best way to hold decadence at bay. Better for parents to be cheerful warriors, to emphasize the joy rather than the misery, while also extending tolerance and understanding — rather than judgment infused with envy — to friends and neighbors who choose a different path. Which is what I pledge to do from here on out. Enjoy your lingering brunches, my childless friends, and I’ll enjoy my rushed meals and puree-stained fingers. Dirty diapers for me, dirty martinis for thee! Let peace and tolerance prevail! And no, of course my angels had nothing whatsoever to do with that stain on your favorite sweater. It must be béarnaise sauce.",1576,742,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/douthat-parental-pity-party.html,2014-02-16,Parental Pity Party
0,thomas,friedman,378,article,"PALO ALTO, Calif. — THE most striking thing about visiting Silicon Valley these days is how many creative ideas you can hear in just 48 hours. Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, explains how his company aims to build an economic graph that will link together the whole global work force with every job being offered in the world, full-time and temporary, for-profit and volunteer, the skills needed for each job, and a presence for every higher education institution everywhere offering a way to acquire those skills. Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, explains how his online storage and collaboration technology is enabling anyone on any mobile device to securely upload files, collaborate, and share content from anywhere to anywhere. Laszlo Bock, who oversees all hiring at Google, lays out the innovative ways his company has learned to identify talented people who have never gone to college. Brian Chesky, the co-founder of Airbnb, explains how his start-up has, in the blink of an eye, become one of the biggest providers of overnight rooms in the world — challenging Hilton and Marriott — without owning a single room. Curt Carlson, the chief executive of SRI International, which invented Siri for your iPhone, recalls how one leading innovator just told him that something would never happen and “then I pick up the paper and it just did.” What they all have in common is they wake up every day and ask: “What are the biggest trends in the world, and how do I best invent/reinvent my business to thrive from them?” They’re fixated on creating abundance, not redividing scarcity, and they respect no limits on imagination. No idea here is “off the table.” Then, after you’ve been totally energized by people inventing the future, you go back to your hotel room and catch up with the present: the news from Washington. Two headlines stand out like flashing red lights: House Speaker John Boehner says immigration reform in 2014 is off the table and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the “fast track” legislation we need to pass vital free-trade agreements with the European Union and some of our biggest trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region is off the table. Forget about both until after the 2014 midterm elections, if not 2016. Summing this all up, The Associated Press reported on Feb. 9 something that you could not make up: “WASHINGTON (AP) — Little more than a week after Groundhog Day, the evidence is mounting that lawmakers have all but wrapped up their most consequential work of 2014, at least until the results of the fall elections are known.” What a contrast. Silicon Valley: where ideas come to launch. Washington, D.C., where ideas go to die. Silicon Valley: where there are no limits on your imagination and failure in the service of experimentation is a virtue. Washington: where the “imagination” to try something new is now a treatable mental illness covered by Obamacare and failure in the service of experimentation is a crime. Silicon Valley: smart as we can be. Washington: dumb as we wanna be. True, some libertarians in Silicon Valley cheer Washington’s paralysis. But it is not so simple. There is a certain “league minimum” that we need and are entitled to expect from Washington, especially today. America just discovered huge deposits of energy and gold at the same time. That is, thanks to advances in drilling technology we have unlocked vast new sources of natural gas, which — if extracted with environmentally sound practices — will give us decades of cheap, cleaner energy and enable America to restore itself as a center of manufacturing. At the same time, the dominance of American companies in cloud computing, and the “Internet of Things” — billions of devices with sensors — have given us a huge lead in the era of Big Data, where the winners will be those who are best at amassing, analyzing and protecting that data and use software to quickly apply what they learn from the data to improve any product or service. These data mountains and the tools to exploit them are the new gold. And we’ve got it. In such an era, one of the two most valuable things Washington can do to create more good jobs and wealth is to open more export markets. The other is to have an immigration policy that not only provides a legal pathway to citizenship for those here illegally but enables America to attract the best brainpower and apply that talent to the data mountains and software opportunities we’re creating. But Washington these days won’t even do the league minimum. As The Economist observed in an essay entitled “When Harry Mugged Barry,” both the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with big Asian markets like Japan, which is almost done, and the U.S.-European Union trade deal, which is being negotiated, are “next generation” agreements that even the playing field for us by requiring higher environmental and labor standards from our trading partners and more access for our software and services. “Studies suggest that proposed deals with Asia and Europe could generate global gains of $600 billion a year, with $200 billion of that going to America,” The Economist added. “And that understates the benefits, since the deals would spur competition in the market for services, which make up most of rich countries’ output but are seldom traded across borders. Opening industries like finance and transport to greater competition could bring great savings to consumers.” The U.S. trade representative, Michael Froman, told me that if we’re able to conclude these two trade deals, America would have free trade with “two-thirds of the world.” If you combine that with our lead in cloud computing, social media, software and natural gas for low-cost manufacturing — plus our rule of law and entrepreneurial cultural — you understand, says Froman, why one European C.E.O. told him that America will be the “production platform of choice” for manufacturers all over the world to set up their operations and export to the world. But it will all have to wait at least until after 2014 when we might have a week to legislate before we get ready for 2016. God forbid either party should challenge their respective bases who oppose freer trade or immigration. That would actually require leadership. We cannot and should not abolish politics, but sometimes we can’t afford politics as usual. And this time, with rising inequality, is one of them. We need to be doing everything we know how to do to create good jobs and growth. “When your mind-set isn’t about creating abundance,” says Carlson of SRI, “you go into extractive mode, which is a death spiral.” Start-up America is our best hope. Sure, we’re doing better than most everyone else, but just being the “cleanest dirty shirt” has never been the American dream.",1075,957,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/friedman-start-up-america-our-best-hope.html,2014-02-16,Start-Up America: Our Best Hope
0,maureen,dowd,686,article,"PARIS — ONLY the French could have an etiquette scandal. Let Americans get in a lather over peccadillos of state. The French are lamenting the state of propriety. No one in the land of Napoleon is following the code. And it is putting the citoyens of this once luminous empire in a dark mood. They are less concerned about their president’s slamming-door farcical adventures in amour than they are about the blow to their amour-propre. They fret that their image is more Feydeau than Rousseau. On this Saint-Valentin weekend, as people join un kiss flash mob at the Louvre, we face another Gallic paradox, like the one about red wine and foie gras keeping you thin. “The whole problem with this Hollande scandal is that he is not married,” says Jean-Marie Rouart, the French novelist. “Had he been married, this affair would never have been revealed.” He observed that, as an “elected monarch,” the president has to maintain appearances. “In France, having a mistress is not considered cheating,” he says. “We are not a puritanical country. France is Catholic. We accept sin and forgiveness.” It’s bad enough to hide under a helmet and dismiss your security and go incognito on an Italian scooter to have a tryst in an apartment that is a stone’s throw from the Élysée Palace and has some tenuous connection to the Corsican Mafia. But everyone here except François Hollande seems to agree: You do not install one mistress at the Élysée when you have another mistress. That is simply bad form. Why should the tabloids stick to the rule of the French press to ignore the private lives of presidents if Hollande breaks the rule of French presidents to lead an “exemplary” public life, which means having a real wife to cheat on? Many now suspect the 59-year-old Hollande, a.k.a. The Living Marshmallow, allowed Mistress No. 1, beautiful 48-year-old Paris Match writer Valérie Trierweiler, to play the role of first concubine to distract her from his affair with Mistress No. 2, gorgeous 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet. Gayet is a committed Socialist who worked on Hollande’s campaign, making kittenish support videos and sporting an “I only date Super Heroes” T-shirt. To assuage Trierweiler for being dubbed “a concubine” in the press, the Rottweiler — as she’s known for her aggressive moves in person and on Twitter — got Élysée offices, a staff of four and a monthly budget of $27,000. But that created some mal de mer among the French, even before the White House had to destroy all its invitations with Valerie’s name when she squared off with her rival, went to the hospital with a case of “the blues,” and was dumped by Hollande in a terse press “communiqué” two weeks before his visit to Washington. “The concept of the first lady doesn’t exist in France, and even less the first mistress,” sniffed Olivier de Rohan, a vicomte and head of a foundation that protects French art. “The protocol in France is very strict. It is not a question of choice or pleasure. The wife of the president of the republic was always seated as the wife, never paraded as the first lady. I don’t care with whom Hollande sleeps. But the whole thing is totally ridiculous, the head of a great state exhibiting mistresses, one after the other.” Or as one French journalist murmured, “All this, in the place where de Gaulle was.” Over good wine and small portions across Paris, there was appalled discussion that Stephen Colbert, who had filleted Hollande’s shenanigans on his show, was seated to the right of Michelle Obama at the state dinner, in the magic circle with the president where Trierweiler would have been, had she not been trundled off to the love guillotine. “In France, it would be extremely rude to do that,” Rohan said about Colbert. “The Americans have no protocol.” Before the dinner, Colbert joked that if the first lady were just the last person you slept with, America’s would have been Monica Lewinsky in 1998. He later crowed about the significance of his placement, yelling “I’m the first lady of France! Merci!” as he was showered with roses. His project, he said, would be “bringing Jean Valjean to justice.” The nation that once worshipped Jerry Lewis was flummoxed by this “terrible faux pas,” as it was dubbed. (Even though Colbert shares a name with a top adviser to Louis XIV, many harbor dark suspicions that he’s Irish.) They wondered how a late-night comic outranked Christine Lagarde, a possible contender to succeed Hollande? Why were more French luminaries not invited? Why did Mary J. Blige sing for Hollande “Ne Me Quitte Pas,” a famous Jacques Brel chanson begging a lover not to leave? Did Michelle, Le Point snarked, think she was providing Colbert with “fresh material” for another searing sketch? The French have spent centuries making fun of us for our puritanism, and now they feel the unbearable sting of our mockery, as our press and comedians chortle at a mediocre pol caught up in a melodrama with all the erotic charge of week-old Camembert. (Maybe that’s why the French got so swept up in the ridiculous but glamorous rumor about Obama and Beyoncé.) All those French expressions we siphon because English isn’t nuanced enough — finesse, etiquette, savoir-faire, rendezvous, je ne sais quoi, comme il faut — Hollande flouted. In the minds of many here, the French president is a loser because he’s so unrefined he might as well be American.",837,742,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/dowd-marry-first-then-cheat.html,2014-02-16,"Marry First, Then Cheat"
0,nicholas,kristof,13967,article,"SOME of the smartest thinkers on problems at home and around the world are university professors, but most of them just don’t matter in today’s great debates. The most stinging dismissal of a point is to say: “That’s academic.” In other words, to be a scholar is, often, to be irrelevant. One reason is the anti-intellectualism in American life, the kind that led Rick Santorum to scold President Obama as “a snob” for wanting more kids to go to college, or that led congressional Republicans to denounce spending on social science research. Yet it’s not just that America has marginalized some of its sharpest minds. They have also marginalized themselves. “All the disciplines have become more and more specialized and more and more quantitative, making them less and less accessible to the general public,” notes Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former dean of the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton and now the president of the New America Foundation. There are plenty of exceptions, of course, including in economics, history and some sciences, in professional schools like law and business, and, above all, in schools of public policy; for that matter, we have a law professor in the White House. But, over all, there are, I think, fewer public intellectuals on American university campuses today than a generation ago. A basic challenge is that Ph.D. programs have fostered a culture that glorifies arcane unintelligibility while disdaining impact and audience. This culture of exclusivity is then transmitted to the next generation through the publish-or-perish tenure process. Rebels are too often crushed or driven away. “Many academics frown on public pontificating as a frivolous distraction from real research,” said Will McCants, a Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution. “This attitude affects tenure decisions. If the sine qua non for academic success is peer-reviewed publications, then academics who ‘waste their time’ writing for the masses will be penalized.” The latest attempt by academia to wall itself off from the world came when the executive council of the prestigious International Studies Association proposed that its publication editors be barred from having personal blogs. The association might as well scream: We want our scholars to be less influential! A related problem is that academics seeking tenure must encode their insights into turgid prose. As a double protection against public consumption, this gobbledygook is then sometimes hidden in obscure journals — or published by university presses whose reputations for soporifics keep readers at a distance. Jill Lepore, a Harvard historian who writes for The New Yorker and is an exception to everything said here, noted the result: “a great, heaping mountain of exquisite knowledge surrounded by a vast moat of dreadful prose.” As experiments, scholars have periodically submitted meaningless gibberish to scholarly journals — only to have the nonsense respectfully published. My onetime love, political science, is a particular offender and seems to be trying, in terms of practical impact, to commit suicide. “Political science Ph.D.’s often aren’t prepared to do real-world analysis,” says Ian Bremmer, a Stanford political science Ph.D. who runs the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, one-fifth of articles in The American Political Science Review focused on policy prescriptions; at last count, the share was down to 0.3 percent. Universities have retreated from area studies, so we have specialists in international theory who know little that is practical about the world. After the Arab Spring, a study by the Stimson Center looked back at whether various sectors had foreseen the possibility of upheavals. It found that scholars were among the most oblivious — partly because they relied upon quantitative models or theoretical constructs that had been useless in predicting unrest. Many academic disciplines also reduce their influence by neglecting political diversity. Sociology, for example, should be central to so many national issues, but it is so dominated by the left that it is instinctively dismissed by the right. In contrast, economics is a rare academic field with a significant Republican presence, and that helps tether economic debates to real-world debates. That may be one reason, along with empiricism and rigor, why economists (including my colleague in columny, Paul Krugman) shape debates on issues from health care to education. Professors today have a growing number of tools available to educate the public, from online courses to blogs to social media. Yet academics have been slow to cast pearls through Twitter and Facebook. Likewise, it was TED Talks by nonscholars that made lectures fun to watch (but I owe a shout-out to the Teaching Company’s lectures, which have enlivened our family’s car rides). I write this in sorrow, for I considered an academic career and deeply admire the wisdom found on university campuses. So, professors, don’t cloister yourselves like medieval monks — we need you!",24626,10911,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/kristof-professors-we-need-you.html,2014-02-16,"Professors, We Need You!"
0,,,40,article,"One of the few bright spots in the struggle to protect the world’s fragile oceans has been the rapidly increasing number of “marine-protected areas,” places where fishing is limited or banned and where, presumably, depleted species can recover by simply being left to themselves. The benefits of hands-off environmental protection may seem self-evident. But creating a preserve and rebuilding a healthy ecosystem are not necessarily the same thing. A recent study published in Nature found that, more often than not, marine-protected areas don’t work as well as they could. Researchers with the University of Tasmania studied 87 marine-protected areas in 40 countries worldwide, and found that 59 percent of the areas were no better off than areas where fishing was allowed. The reasons for failure varied, but they boiled down to this: Not all marine-protected areas are alike. Some allow fishing; others forbid it. Some are managed well; others are managed badly. Some are relatively intact; others have been left barren by generations of overfishing. The researchers identified five essential characteristics of the most successful marine-protected areas: These areas were designated “no take” (allowing no fishing whatsoever), their rules were well enforced, they were more than 10 years old, they were bigger than 100 square kilometers, and they were isolated by deep water or sand. Compared with regular fished areas, the areas that had four or five of those attributes had a far richer variety of species, five times the biomass of large fish and 14 times the biomass of sharks, which are indicators of ecological health. Most underachieving marine sanctuaries had only one or two of these magic factors, and thus “were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites.” The four sanctuaries lucky enough to have all five characteristics were isolated areas in the oceans off Costa Rica, Colombia, New Zealand and Australia. The “coral triangle” of Southeast Asia also got high marks, but it did not have as great an array of large species as its more isolated counterparts. You could say the scientists were simply discovering the obvious — that a “protected” area hardly deserves the name if it’s so small that fish swim out of it, or if poachers are allowed to plunder it. But it would be an overreaction to despair over this report. Marine-protected areas are clearly a positive trend, a reflection of the growing awareness of governments across the globe that the oceans and their bounty are not limitless or indestructible. There is greater understanding of the urgent need to ease the commercial pressures on fragile, increasingly acidified, steadily warming and rising oceans, lest the reefs die and the birds and fish disappear. The worst conclusion to reach from this eye-opening report would be to dismiss the value of marine-protected areas. It takes time for fish to grow and get bigger. Decades of damage can’t be undone overnight. Governments and scientists need to work together to better design, maintain, improve and protect “protected areas.” The creation of a marine-protected area is only the start of an effective conservation effort, not the end.",521,248,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/to-save-fish-and-birds.html,2014-02-16,To Save Fish and Birds
0,,,5,article,"Just a few years ago, the rivalry between mainland China and Taiwan was seen as one of the more likely triggers for international conflict. But while fundamental differences remain, the two sides have worked to ease tensions. The most dramatic recent example was Tuesday’s meeting between the head of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, Wang Yu-chi, and the head of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Zhang Zhijun. It was the first government-to-government meeting since the end of China’s civil war in 1949, when the Communists drove the nationalists from the mainland to Taiwan. Further peaceful exchanges like this one should be encouraged. The actual results of the meeting, held in the mainland city of Nanjing, were modest. The two sides reportedly discussed establishing offices on each other’s territory at some undetermined future point. While no agreement on any topic was announced, they laid the ground for more regular contacts and a broader dialogue on political issues that go beyond the trade and economic issues that have dominated unofficial lower-level talks in the past. Normally, the two sides have communicated through unofficial groups or through retired officials, thus allowing Beijing to persist in its refusal to recognize Taiwan’s sovereignty. But President Xi Jinping of China seems to feel some urgency to elevate the dialogue to the official level. He said last October that resolving the political impasse between China and Taiwan could not be postponed indefinitely. The big question, of course, as it always has been, is what that relationship should be. Beijing has long been committed to the idea that Taiwan, a democratic, self-governing island, is a renegade territory that must be united with the mainland. In the past, Chinese officials have threatened to use force, if needed, to achieve this outcome. But pushing Taiwan for a decision on its long-term relationship with China is likely to backfire, causing anxiety among the Taiwanese and raising tensions throughout the region. Although an advocate of closer ties with China, President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan has been reluctant to move faster on political issues, including a possible peace agreement, that could be interpreted as steps toward unification. Polls show that the overwhelming majority of Taiwanese favor the status quo, even as they have supported Mr. Ma’s efforts to forge closer economic ties with the mainland. Cross-straits trade over the course of Mr. Ma’s presidency has doubled, reaching $197 billion in 2013. China-Taiwan relations were extremely volatile from 2000 to 2008 when Chen Shui-bian, then Taiwan’s president, preached a pro-independence line. Beijing has taken a more conciliatory approach since Mr. Ma, who has said he will not pursue formal independence, was elected in 2008. The approach is designed to make Taiwan feel safe and to make the Taiwanese feel unification is inevitable. No one knows who will succeed Mr. Ma when his term ends in two years, and Taiwan’s future must be decided by its own citizens. For now, though, the current China-Taiwan path seems to be working for both sides.",28,34,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/an-encouraging-chinese-courtship.html,2014-02-16,An Encouraging Chinese Courtship
0,,,140,article,"If you need something out of Washington and want to give a satchel of cash to a political candidate, no need to give it directly to the candidate. Federal law limits those contributions to $2,600 anyway. The thing to do is to give the money to the candidate’s “super PAC,” where no limits apply, to pay for attack ads against the candidate’s opponent. That’s the path chosen by John Childs, a private-equity investor, who gave $250,000 to Senator Mitch McConnell’s super PAC, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership. (Could it have anything to do with Mr. McConnell’s staunch opposition to a tax increase on hedge fund managers, favored by President Obama and Democrats?) Joseph Craft, a billionaire coal executive, gave $100,000, and Donald Trump gave $50,000 to the same group. Naturally, Mr. McConnell’s Democratic opponent in the Kentucky Senate race, Alison Lundergan Grimes, set up her own super PAC, We Are Kentucky, to attract money from those on the left who would love to oust the Senate minority leader. The United Auto Workers gave it $100,000, as did the big plumbing and pipe-fitting union. This election year will be the moment when individual candidate super PACs — a form of legalized bribery — become a truly toxic force in American politics. The giant ideological super PACs formed by political operatives like Karl Rove spent hundreds of millions in 2012, but didn’t produce the conservative revolution demanded by the big donors. So now the torrent of cash is heading toward smaller groups set up to promote a single candidate or, more often, to trash that candidate’s opponent. Dozens of these groups have already been formed, and political professionals predict that virtually every Senate race this year, and many contested House races, will have one or more. They can accept unlimited contributions, and thanks to the Citizens United decision, such donations can come from unions and corporations, too. Strictly speaking, these groups can have no contact with the candidate, but that prohibition is a joke. Most of them use the same voter lists as the campaigns, make the same points in their ads, and often are run by cronies of the candidate. The super PAC of Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, was set up by Charles Spies, whose law firm represents Mr. Vitter. The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that two of the fund-raisers for the super PAC are also paid fund-raisers of Mr. Vitter’s campaign. If that’s not coordination, it’s hard to imagine what is. But that kind of thing goes on all the time, because there’s little enforcement of the rules by the toothless Federal Election Commission. Democrats have eagerly joined the cash race, and so far their super PACs are raising more money than those of Republicans. Priorities USA Action, Mr. Obama’s super PAC in 2012, recently announced that it would switch its allegiance to Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016, and that it plans to surpass the $67 million it spent on attack ads against Mitt Romney. Remember the Nixon campaign’s safe in 1972, so overstuffed with cash and checks that his buddies barely knew how to spend all the money? That’s what these super PACs have become, violating the intent of all the post-Watergate reforms. Once again, Congress will have to step in to stop the corruption, and fortunately a good reform vehicle exists: the Empowering Citizens Act, a bill introduced by two House Democrats, David Price and Chris Van Hollen, which would limit the spending of super PACs closely aligned to a campaign. The bill’s language still needs improvement to rein in groups like Priorities USA Action, which is not as clearly allied with Mrs. Clinton’s aides as, say, Mr. Vitter’s group. But the act still represents the best chance for ridding politics of special-interest cash and preventing another era of scandal.",565,485,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/the-line-at-the-super-pac-trough.html,2014-02-16,The Line at the ‘Super PAC’ Trough
0,randi,epstein,180,article,"WHEN my water broke during the 35th week of my first pregnancy, I waddled down the block to our neighborhood’s brand-new hospital. This was in London, where I then lived, around 2 a.m., Dec. 13, 1993. The nurse-midwife examined me and telephoned my doctor to say he needn’t bother coming in. I was a long way from giving birth. Shortly thereafter, the pain started to surge. The nurse gave me some laughing gas. It didn’t make me laugh and it didn’t nip the pain, either. I paced around the room and crouched on all fours. I think I tried every position minus doing a handstand against the wall. Eventually, I tried to explain to the midwife that I thought my body was ripping apart. She explained to me that I wasn’t even in real labor yet. If this wasn’t real labor, I wasn’t sure I was going to survive. But about 7 o’clock, the midwife panicked. She called the doctor and whispered that he should come immediately. Something about a mass, blood. I had no idea what was going on, but at least it meant the doctor was coming. He arrived at 7:15, looked between my legs, flipped his red tie over his shoulder and grabbed a white coat. “The head is coming out,” he said. Hence the pain. I pushed and my son, Jack, was born. “Congratulations. Right, then. Breakfast.” And off he went. The midwife was mortified. She said she had been timing contractions and mine weren’t even at all and this was her first delivery and all the textbooks said that before birth the contractions come every few minutes at regular intervals. I wasn’t a textbook case. I was recently reminded of this by a study published this month in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. We’ve known for some time that epidural anesthesia prolongs the second stage of labor — the pushing stage — maybe because it reduces sensation in women’s lower bodies. But the study suggests that it is normal, and therefore not unhealthy, for this stage to last significantly longer than we had assumed. For a first birth with an epidural, it can be upwards of five and a half hours, instead of up to three, as had previously been believed. The message being that doctors should wait longer before trying to speed things along by turning to instruments like forceps or vacuums; oxytocin, a hormone that triggers contractions; or cesarean sections. But will this study really initiate a change, or will we cling to what the last textbooks taught us? When it comes to pregnancy and delivery, we’re always searching for a recipe book we can follow. But the way we make babies and push them out is and has always been a murky brew of science, expert judgment, hunches and traditions. Whether we grab at new findings or let them incubate has more to do with this than scientific rigor. It’s always been so. When male doctors started delivering babies in the 1800s, they slipped their hands beneath a tent of sheets, fumbling to get the baby out without peeking. The patient’s privates were private. Doctors insisted they offered women a safer and more scientific delivery, compared with those midwives who watched what they were doing but didn’t have the credentials. In the early 1900s, feminists crusaded for Twilight Sleep, a concoction of drugs that didn’t numb the pain of childbirth but made you forget all about it. (Women were blindfolded and also strapped to the bed in this purportedly assertive way of birth.) In the early days, the ingredients (scopolamine and morphine) were measured haphazardly. In the 1940s, when women were devouring books about scientific motherhood, bed rest after childbirth was deemed healthy. We called pregnancy “confinement” and maternity hospitals “lying-ins.” Bernice Levine, a grandmother in Brooklyn, told me that when she gave birth in 1944 the doctor ordered her to stay in the hospital, flat on her back. She was only “allowed to dangle after eight days. That’s what they called it, dangling,” she said. “You got to hang your feet over the bed.” In the 1950s, doctors threatened my mother that if she gained more than 15 pounds during her pregnancy with my sister, they’d put her in the hospital and monitor her food intake. Some of her friends were given diet pills, the kind with amphetamines. Doctors thought too much weight gain triggered pre-eclampsia, dangerously high blood pressure. Now we know that pre-eclampsia causes weight gain, not the other way around. I’m guilty of clinging to my own assumptions. When I was in labor with my fourth child, back in 2000, I remember telling the nurse that I just couldn’t take the pain. “If you can make it 15 minutes longer,” she told me, “the baby will come out.” I looked at the clock — it was 5 p.m. — and did the math. I divided 15 by three and knew that I would have five more sharp contractions that lasted 30 seconds each, for a total of 150 seconds of pain. O.K., I’d forgo the meds. I’m not sure why I thought that my contractions were every three minutes. I hadn’t even been timing them. I must have gotten it from the same textbook as my midwife, three babies before. But, although the data was bogus, I felt comforted. I thought I knew exactly what was going to happen and when. And in this case, though it was nothing but coincidence, my daughter Eliza arrived as predicted: 5:15 p.m. Of course we need new studies, like this latest one, to correct our assumptions. Yvonne W. Cheng, the lead author of the study, told The New York Times that “it’s time to re-examine what normal and abnormal is.” But that’s the crux of the issue: figuring out who is normal and who isn’t, who needs treatment and who doesn’t. Luckily, good doctors don’t make those decisions based on the length of labor alone. Edmund Funai, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Ohio State University College of Medicine, who was not involved in the study but who said he worries about the medicalization of childbirth, described it this way: “You aren’t just putting a woman in a room, shutting the door, and setting the timer.” Throughout history, the best doctors have been those who resisted the fads. Many American doctors in the 1910s refused to administer Twilight Sleep, fearing side effects, but the next generation of obstetricians, for whatever reason, seemed more comfortable using the drugs. That is, until women themselves started fighting against them, beginning as early as the 1950s. Today’s doctors should take this new information into consideration. But for the most part, they will do what they have been doing: looking to the clock, but also looking to the monitor and to the patient, and using their experience to decide what to do and when.",953,410,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/the-lore-of-labor.html,2014-02-16,The Lore of Labor
0,emma,brockes,644,article,"BY the end of 2013, more than half a billion people had installed Candy Crush Saga, and the addictive game app was generating just a little less than $1 million per day, according to its developer, King. Candy Crush Saga was the most downloaded app of the year in 2013, according to Apple. — International Business Times, Feb. 10 A few levels in, the newcomer wonders: What if Candy Crush is entirely random? What if there’s no skill involved? A few levels later: What if it’s not random? What if the game drops candy into the grid in formations designed to let me win or lose at strategic points contrived by the makers to keep me hooked? But wait: If I don’t buy any “boosters,” what if it decides not to let me win and keeps me on level 35 forever? I’ve been on this level for two weeks. How long am I going to persist with this? Will I keep placidly playing this game over and over like the frog in boiling water, passive in the face of its own destruction? What if how you play Candy Crush is how you play life? Is it a test of my character? Am I really getting one over on the system by not buying the boosters? I’m not buying the boosters. As a user, what value am I to the maker if I don’t buy the boosters? Can I play Candy Crush holding the phone in one hand while keeping adequate purchase on the baby with the other? When pieces of candy flash, indicating a move, is the game helping or hindering me? Is it mocking me? Am I in danger of getting “Candy Crush Shoulder,” like my friend’s mother? Is it pathetic that after three months of playing twice daily on the subway, I still can’t make up my mind about this? Is it less pathetic if I play with the sound turned down? Why am I embarrassed when someone sees me playing Candy Crush, particularly if she is also playing Candy Crush? When I lie to a friend who asks what I’m doing by saying, “I’m on Twitter,” and she sees the screen and says, “You’re gross,” is she right? Why does reading a book, which doesn’t award points to me for reading it, suddenly seem so unappealing? Was that my subway stop? Which is more powerful, the wrapped thing or the multicolored disco-ball thing? If it’s the disco-ball thing, does it make any difference which color I nuke it with? If the yellow thing is a lemon drop and the red thing is a jelly bean, what is the purple thing? What am I even talking about? When the words “You failed!” flash up on screen at the end of the game, am I actually a failure? How big is this failure? If the maker, a British company named King, files for an I.P.O., should I buy shares? How many shares should I buy? How do you buy shares? Why am I even still playing Candy Crush when all the cool kids are talking about Flappy Bird? Is there anything more tragic than an outmoded addiction?",581,569,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/the-never-ending-candy-crush-saga.html,2014-02-16,The Never-Ending Candy Crush Saga
0,beth,machlan,625,article,"I BOUGHT my car, a Jetta wagon, back in 2006. It was four years old and came with a five-CD cartridge lodged, impractically, over a rear wheel well. Not surprisingly, the CD player refuses to function on any less-than-perfect road — and in Brooklyn, where I live, there are few perfect roads. Even stop-and-start traffic makes the discs, well, stop and start. So when we want to hear music in the car, which is always, my family relies on the ad-riddled idiosyncrasies of commercial radio. I know there are other options. I’ve tried all of them. I’ve plugged adapters into the cassette player — yes, I have a cassette player, if you’re dying to hear that mixtape your boyfriend made you in 1987 — to connect my iPod. I’ve tried to support indies like WFMU, but my scanner sails right past them. I sampled satellite radio in my brother’s space-age minivan that parallel parks itself and changes stations at the sound of his voice. (He asked me to drive it for him once; I told him I wasn’t a licensed astronaut.) All that’s left are the signals strong enough for my bottom-of-the-line radio to receive. Usually, we flip back and forth between classic rock on Q104.3 and “the best of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s” on 101.1, CBS FM, unless a double dose of “Hotel California” forces us to seek refuge in the mainstream pop on WPLJ. It’s not so bad, really: My daughters explain who Pink and Fun are (but not why they’re called Pink and Fun); I explain to them, as my parents explained to me, that Creedence Clearwater Revival is singing about a “bad moon on the rise,” not a bathroom on the right. On a good day, we all learn something. I grew up on these stations, these voices. One of my earliest New York City memories is of being bundled with my brothers in the back of my father’s car, sometime in the late ’70s, barreling up the West Side Highway, watching the lights of the George Washington Bridge swoop through the sky as CBS FM counted down “The Top 100 Songs of All Time.” (“In the Still of the Night” by the Five Satins always seemed to be No. 1.) At 16, after failing my first road test, I was still in the back seat, but the car was my friend’s Cabriolet, and the radio was tuned to Z100 to catch George Michael’s “I Want Your Sex” or “Nasty” by Janet Jackson. Then, as now, Top 40 songs were so ubiquitous that, when they ended, we simply spun the dial and found them again. Like the songs we sweat to at the gym, the songs we want to hear in the car are not necessarily the ones we love at home. For me, home is Big Star, classic Stax, the Avett Brothers; the car is Beyoncé, Bad Company, Tommy James and the Shondells. Twenty years ago, two college friends of mine with intimidatingly hip taste in music used to drive around Portland, Me., waiting for the classic rock station to play Pearl Jam’s “Better Man”; they would never buy the album, but on the road they loved to sing the song. The car is a musical separate sphere, where some days Kansas’ dirgelike “Dust in the Wind” will be on three out of four stations, while on others I’ll be blessed with “Loves Me Like a Rock,” “Midnight Train to Georgia” and “Cruel to Be Kind,” all in a row. It’s true that on stations with “classic” playlists like CBS and Q104, the songs have been selected through complex corporate algorithms to appeal to listeners just like me. But I’m glad my daughters are being exposed to music they would otherwise never hear. I know that commercial radio conforms to strict playlists, but when I’m driving, it still feels like the music of chance. I surrender control and let the music play. If every moment of my kids’ musical experience originated from iTunes, I would have missed many perfect moments — like 10-year-old Lucy’s horrified response to “Another Brick in the Wall” (“This school district sounds terrible”) or her older sister Maggie’s conviction that Frankie Valli is actually Elmo. THERE are downsides to this lack of control, of course, like realizing that your fifth grader is singing “my angel is the centerfold” to herself while doing her homework. (Better than “Thrift Shop,” I guess.) But I think it’s worth the risk. Sometimes the green lights line up just right and we fly down Ocean Parkway, singing along to the glorious chorus of Boz Scaggs’s “Lido Shuffle”: “Leeeedo — Oh-oh-OH-ohohoh!” Carrie Fisher’s heroine in “Postcards From the Edge” felt that “God was in her car radio, and He would play her songs she liked when He was happiest with her.” I’m not sure about God, but I know that when serendipity provides a perfect soundtrack to my life, I get a rare sense of both contingency and convergence. Downloading “Superstition” or pulling it up on Spotify is simply not the same as catching it on the radio just as the D.J.’s voice fades into Stevie Wonder’s unforgettably ominous intro. I can’t predict or depend on the random perfection of these moments, nor can I design every aspect of my daughters’ lives. Some things just happen, but they can happen only if we unplug our devices and hit the road. So let’s say goodbye, however briefly, to the satellites. (They will still be up there when we’re done. They will be up there forever.) Let’s try the scan feature on our radios, and search for songs we haven’t heard in years, or decades. Listen to ads for local restaurants we’ll probably never visit. Give in to the static and stretch of a messy world that doesn’t fit on a screen. Commercial radio is hardly the voice of the people, but I’m willing to bet that it’s more various than the one on your phone. There are limits, of course: no need to subject ourselves to “Blurred Lines” or “Brown Sugar.” (I love the Rolling Stones, but why is this racist song still on the air?) Like Cheap Trick says, “Surrender, but don’t give yourself away.” At 14, Maggie guards her iPod like a Gorgon. I’m no longer allowed to load songs on it without her approval. I can’t complain about her taste; she loves Radiohead, Phoenix, the White Stripes and the Breeders. But she also likes to ride in the car just to listen to the radio. Her hand bumps mine as she reaches to change the station, and I downshift into second for the inevitable backup on the Prospect Expressway. To Maggie, traffic just means more music. She lands on Don Henley’s “Boys of Summer,” which takes me back to the beach in 1985, tan boys in U2 shirts and, yes, Wayfarers. I’m afraid she’s going to breeze by it, but she settles back, smiling. “Really?” I ask, amused. Maggie’s hair is blue. She’s wearing ripped jeans and Doc Martens and a Neko Case T-shirt, and she is fresh from a bass lesson at the cheerfully hip Brooklyn Music Factory. “Yeah,” she replies, eyes closed. “This is my jam.”",1663,409,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/driving-to-the-music-of-chance.html,2014-02-16,Driving to the Music of Chance
0,william,cohan,156,article,"MAYBE it’s those five Oscar nominations for “The Wolf of Wall Street,” including for best picture, best director and best actor, but we seem to be in another of those moments in popular culture when Hollywood plies us with skewed answers about how Wall Street miscreants caused so much mayhem. We have seen this movie before: The genre owes much to the director Oliver Stone’s original “Wall Street,” which played off the excesses of the 1980s and was released just after the crash of 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.6 percent on a single October day. But more recent grist for the mill has been provided by “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” “Margin Call” and “Arbitrage.” Jordan Belfort, the antihero of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a direct descendant of Mr. Stone’s creation, Gordon Gekko — he of the maxim, “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.” As a cautionary tale of a repeat cycle of greed that led to our latest bubble and bust, “The Wolf of Wall Street” is quite a portrait that the director Martin Scorsese has painted for us. There are the quaaludes and the mounds of cocaine, the prostitutes and the Hamptons mansions, the substance-fueled orgies and the fast cars, the deceit and criminality, and yes, the greed and — did I mention the quaaludes? It’s all wildly entertaining — even if, technically, the business model depicted in Mr. Scorsese’s film is fairly remote from any actual or even figurative Wall Street bank: In the “boiler room operation” located at a Long Island strip mall, barely qualified salesmen pressured the naïve into buying highly risky stocks of marginal companies. I can sympathize with Mr. Scorsese’s problem. Can you imagine the box office bomb that would have resulted had he chosen a scenario in which Mr. DiCaprio played a recent Ivy League graduate poring over an Excel spreadsheet at 2 a.m.? But it’s not only Hollywood that is marketing lurid depictions of a Wall Street culture prone to the most flagrant of moral lapses. Last month, we learned that “J. T. Stone,” the pseudonym for the assumed Goldman Sachs banker behind the satirical “@GSElevator” Twitter feed (619,000 followers and counting), had inked a deal for “Straight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance and Excess in the World of Investment Banking.” Mr. Stone’s tell-all book promises to reveal “a world that is far more abhorrent, and yet, way more entertaining than people can imagine.”  But do these portrayals bear any relation to quotidian life in the salt mines of high finance? My 17 years’ experience on Wall Street, mostly spent as a mergers and acquisitions banker at Lazard, Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase, where I was a managing director, admittedly ended a decade ago, but it could not have been more different from what these popular-culture sensations would have us believe about working in finance. (True, I never worked at a bucket shop like Stratton Oakmont — the two-bit brokerage started by Jordan Belfort, the author of the memoir adapted by Mr. Scorsese as “The Wolf.” Nor did I ever work on a trading desk at Goldman Sachs, so perhaps I missed the raucous and ribald workplace that Mr. Stone is intent on portraying.) My Wall Street was an endless-seeming succession of late nights, ruled by the demands of clients and bosses. An investment banking crisis, in my world, was when a surly senior banker would finally deign to look at a client presentation the night before it was due. The ensuing tirade would require me and my team to pull all-nighters to make the changes she or he demanded. Mine, too, was the glamour of a red-eye flight to a European capital to meet with the executives of a large corporation. There was no time for sleep because of the inevitable fiddling with the presentation. I remember biting the inside of my lip to stay awake in those late-afternoon meetings.  I lived in a constant fugue state, rushing from one meeting to the next, constantly hoping a chief executive would pursue the deal I was advocating. Getting hired for a new assignment, with its potential for a multimillion-dollar fee for the firm, was a rare moment of drug-free euphoria — to be followed by the long downer of sleepless nights as I toiled to make the deal happen. I used to say of investment banking that it was good one day a year: the day you got your bonus. The kicker: that bonus was nothing more than the present value of an inevitable pink slip. Being well paid but expendable was a fact of life. Hubris and excess? Yes, I saw plenty, too. There was always the banker or trader who, without a second’s thought, would plunk down $100,000 in cash for a Porsche 911 Carrera or $250,000 for a summer rental in the Hamptons. And how to top the fact that Richard S. Fuld Jr., the final chief executive of Lehman Brothers, is estimated to have made $520 million in cumulative compensation while presiding over the collapse of his firm? Yet my abiding memory is the drudgery of it all — none of which has ever been captured on film or in print. With good reason: much of what happens on Wall Street is terrifically boring. The allocation of capital is not, as a rule, sexy. But the way capital becomes available to start new companies or to allow existing ones to expand and hire new workers is vital for our collective wealth as a society. That is Wall Street’s untold tale: the crucial and economically beneficial role capital markets play. As much fun as they are as fantasies, what the caricatures of Wall Street do is obscure the very real need to change the behavior of Wall Street’s bankers, traders and executives. I am not talking about drinking and drugging; people who overindulge quickly burn themselves out on Wall Street. The change Wall Street needs is about what people get rewarded to do, which is to take risks with other people’s money. We saw how corrosive bad incentives were in the years leading up the financial crisis, when huge bonuses were paid to those who bundled up millions of faulty mortgages into securities and sold them as safe investments to people all over the world. Many of them knew better, but they did it anyway. Speculating without any concern about being held accountable is exactly what the army of Wall Street bankers and traders will continue to do. Regardless of the fact that this very behavior was a key cause of the recent financial mess, that is what they are still being rewarded to do. Wall Streeters like to extol the complexity of their work, but in reality, it’s that simple. The Dodd-Frank Act, the Volcker Rule, the increased capital requirements and the rest have done next to nothing to change the fundamental fact that bankers and traders are still being rewarded to take imprudent risks with other people’s money in order to get big bonuses. That’s the Wall Street reality. The rest is just entertainment.",509,360,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/the-tame-truth-about-the-wolves-of-wall-street.html,2014-02-16,The Tame Truth About the Wolves of Wall Street
0,serge,schmemann,0,article,"It was a week of grand spectacles that would have made Julius “Bread and Circuses” Caesar proud. There were the Sochi Games, of course, a festival of sports both familiar and arcane, many set against the stunning white peaks of the Caucasus. And there was the state dinner on the South Lawn of the White House for President François Hollande of France, so rich in pomp and gossip that it was easy to forget that the host was a liberal and the guest a socialist, and that both their countries were forged in revolution. And on the medical front, there was the sobering report of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, which found that universal screening with mammograms does little good, and in fact may do some harm — effectively confirming the United States Preventive Services Task Force’s move to scale back its recommendations in 2009, which was met with widespread skepticism. Russia’s Triumph In the run-up to the Winter Olympics, there was a lot of reporting outside Russia about double toilets, unfinished hotels, condemned dogs, persecution of gays, huge costs and, of course, President Vladimir V. Putin’s determination to create a monument to his Russia. Once the games got underway, however, the coverage was suddenly all about sport — the competitions we know well, like downhill skiing and hockey; those we don’t, like skeleton (that’s the one in which a person lying facedown on a tiny sled hurtles down a frozen track at over 80 miles per hour), and those we smirk at, namely curling (though it turns out curlers can also be hurt and travel with trainers). This is the keen pleasure of the Olympic Games, that we are treated day after day to sports we would not normally watch or even know about, to plunge briefly into these different worlds with their own rules, heroes and cultures. The snowboarders bouncing down rails and over moguls; the short-track speed skaters leaning almost to the rink; the curlers frantically sweeping the ice; the biathlon skiers fighting for breath as they aim their strangely complex .22 rifles — for two weeks, these and the other sports on snow or ice become part of our daily life. Yes, there may be too many events — 98 this time around, compared with 57 in 1992 — and some of them, like the luge, may be too specialized. Yet for Olympics junkies like me, the drama is wonderful. Russia’s 15-year-old Yulia Lipnitskaya spent only a few minutes on the ice, but nobody who watched her will forget her. And how about that amazing tie for gold in the women’s downhill between Switzerland’s Dominique Gisin and Slovenia’s Tina Maze? Up to now there has been little to fault, and I’m happy to say there’s a lot more to come — though temperatures in the Caucasus have been rising to uncomfortably warm levels. A few words here about Russia. Mr. Putin deserves much of the flak he gets. But that should not detract viewers from appreciating the grand effort to show that Russia is back from the rubble of the Soviet collapse. The opening pageant — a genre Russians created in large part at the 1980 Moscow Games — was a remarkable hymn to Russian history and culture as Mr. Putin and many of his countrymen want it to be seen, ranging from the magnificence of Russian literature, ballet and art to the country’s vastness, Soviet monumentalism and scientific achievement. And as Andrew E. Kramer and Steven Lee Myers reported from Sochi, it works at home — even Russians highly critical of Mr. Putin and his government are unabashedly proud of their country and these games. The fact is that the Sochi Games are a reflection of Russia today — the corruption, the extravagance, the flawed rule, but also the pride, the vastness, the culture and the potential. Russia is back. Dinner Gossip In the midst of it all, Monsieur Hollande went to Washington. Alone. Just in case anyone forgot, the French president was recently abandoned by his consort, Valérie Trierweiler, after a gossip magazine revealed he had been cheating on her with an actress. One result was that at the state dinner for 350 or so on Tuesday in a tent out on the South Lawn, Ms. Trierweiler’s original place to President Obama’s left was filled by Thelma Golden, the director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. Another result was that the dinner attracted far more coverage than the previous five held at the Obama White House. The dinner raised the usual chatter about costs and needless pomp. But White House state dinners, from the time President Ulysses S. Grant inaugurated the tradition with a feast for King David Kalakaua of Hawaii, have played a serious role in international affairs. They are first and foremost diplomatic theater, intended to reinforce a close relationship between two states and to impress the public in both countries. Certainly the principals at this one need a bit of propping up — Mr. Hollande as he struggles with his scandals and sagging popularity, and Mr. Obama as he emerges from a nasty stretch of partisan warfare. Beyond that, the welcome for Mr. Hollande underscored that France has become Washington’s strongest European security partner. Britain’s Parliament blocked military action against Syria last August, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, is seething over the eavesdropping on her phone conversations. The French, meanwhile, have supported United States policy in Syria and Iran and have taken military action of their own in Mali and the Central African Republic. Part of the ritual calls for toasts, and here the Gallic leader upstaged his New World host. “Vive la France, God bless America, and long live the alliance between our great nations,” was Mr. Obama’s line. To which the French president, who is known as something of a wit among his friends, replied: “We love Americans, although we don’t always say so. And you love the French, but you are sometimes too shy to say so.” Skip the Test? The results of the Canadian breast screening study were published Tuesday in the British Medical Journal. The conclusion: “Annual mammography in women aged 40-59 does not reduce mortality from breast cancer beyond that of physical examination or usual care when adjuvant therapy for breast cancer is freely available.” Moreover, the study found that a fifth of cancers found with mammography did not need treatment. The debate over mammography has been going on for some time now, with growing skepticism about the tests countered by adamant advocates. The Canadian study, however, involved nearly 90,000 women over 25 years, so it will be harder to dismiss. No quick changes in existing American guidelines were expected, and some women who are accustomed to a mammogram as part of their routine care are likely to be reluctant to stop getting them. Nearly three-fourths of women 40 and over in the United States say they’ve had a mammogram in the past year; in some European countries, more than 90 percent of women between 50 and 70 have had at least one test. So far, Switzerland is the only country to suggest that the screening programs be halted, but others may now begin following suit.",0,3,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/flips-and-spins-in-sochi-and-on-mammograms.html,2014-02-16,Flips and Spins in Sochi and on Mammograms
0,edward,frenkel,12346,article,"IN Mikhail Bulgakov’s novel “The Master and Margarita,” the protagonist, a writer, burns a manuscript in a moment of despair, only to find out later from the Devil that “manuscripts don’t burn.” While you might appreciate this romantic sentiment, there is of course no reason to think that it is true. Nikolai Gogol apparently burned the second volume of “Dead Souls,” and it has been lost forever. Likewise, if Bulgakov had burned his manuscript, we would have never known “Master and Margarita.” No other author would have written the same novel. But there is one area of human endeavor that comes close to exemplifying the maxim “manuscripts don’t burn.” That area is mathematics. If Pythagoras had not lived, or if his work had been destroyed, someone else eventually would have discovered the same Pythagorean theorem. Moreover, this theorem means the same thing to everyone today as it meant 2,500 years ago, and will mean the same thing to everyone a thousand years from now — no matter what advances occur in technology or what new evidence emerges. Mathematical knowledge is unlike any other knowledge. Its truths are objective, necessary and timeless. What kinds of things are mathematical entities and theorems, that they are knowable in this way? Do they exist somewhere, a set of immaterial objects in the enchanted gardens of the Platonic world, waiting to be discovered? Or are they mere creations of the human mind? This question has divided thinkers for centuries. It seems spooky to suggest that mathematical entities actually exist in and of themselves. But if math is only a product of the human imagination, how do we all end up agreeing on exactly the same math? Some might argue that mathematical entities are like chess pieces, elaborate fictions in a game invented by humans. But unlike chess, mathematics is indispensable to scientific theories describing our universe. And yet there are many mathematical concepts — from esoteric numerical systems to infinite-dimensional spaces — that we don’t currently find in the world around us. In what sense do they exist? Many mathematicians, when pressed, admit to being Platonists. The great logician Kurt Gödel argued that mathematical concepts and ideas “form an objective reality of their own, which we cannot create or change, but only perceive and describe.” But if this is true, how do humans manage to access this hidden reality? We don’t know. But one fanciful possibility is that we live in a computer simulation based on the laws of mathematics — not in what we commonly take to be the real world. According to this theory, some highly advanced computer programmer of the future has devised this simulation, and we are unknowingly part of it. Thus when we discover a mathematical truth, we are simply discovering aspects of the code that the programmer used. This may strike you as very unlikely. But the Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom has argued that we are more likely to be in such a simulation than not. If such simulations are possible in theory, he reasons, then eventually humans will create them — presumably many of them. If this is so, in time there will be many more simulated worlds than nonsimulated ones. Statistically speaking, therefore, we are more likely to be living in a simulated world than the real one. Very clever. But is there any way to empirically test this hypothesis? Indeed, there may be. In a recent paper, “Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation,” the physicists Silas R. Beane, Zohreh Davoudi and Martin J. Savage outline a possible method for detecting that our world is actually a computer simulation. Physicists have been creating their own computer simulations of the forces of nature for years — on a tiny scale, the size of an atomic nucleus. They use a three-dimensional grid to model a little chunk of the universe; then they run the program to see what happens. This way, they have been able to simulate the motion and collisions of elementary particles. But these computer simulations, Professor Beane and his colleagues observe, generate slight but distinctive anomalies — certain kinds of asymmetries. Might we be able to detect these same distinctive anomalies in the actual universe, they wondered? In their paper, they suggest that a closer look at cosmic rays, those high-energy particles coming to Earth’s atmosphere from outside the solar system, may reveal similar asymmetries. If so, this would indicate that we might — just might — ourselves be in someone else’s computer simulation. Are we prepared to take the “red pill,” as Neo did in “The Matrix,” to see the truth behind the illusion — to see “how deep the rabbit hole goes”? Perhaps not yet. The jury is still out on the simulation hypothesis. But even if it proves too far-fetched, the possibility of the Platonic nature of mathematical ideas remains — and may hold the key to understanding our own reality.",15370,11349,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/is-the-universe-a-simulation.html,2014-02-16,Is the Universe a Simulation?
0,kenan,malik,565,article,"LONDON —  The British queen is down to her last pennies. Well, actually, her last millions of pennies. Last month, the Public Accounts Committee — Parliament’s watchdog on public spending — published a damning survey of the state of the royal finances. The queen had spent down her “reserve fund,” a savings account built up by years of surplus public subsidy, to “a historically low level” of only £1 million ($1.6 million), from £35.3 million in 2001. Trying to make sense of the royal finances is like trying to eat spaghetti with a spoon. Here’s the puzzle: Queen Elizabeth II is often described, by some measures, as one of the richest people in the world. Among her private property is Balmoral Castle, her residence in the Scottish Highlands, which was purchased, together with a 50,000-acre estate, by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria in 1848. Queen Elizabeth also owns stud farms, personal art and fine jewelry. According to Forbes magazine, her personal worth is $500 million. If the queen is so wealthy, how can she be strapped for cash? In 2010, it emerged that the queen had even privately applied to a government fund normally reserved for low-income families to help with Buckingham Palace’s heating bills. Turning the request down, a government official commented, “I also feel a bit uneasy about the probable adverse press coverage if the palace were given a grant at the expense of, say, a hospital.” Why is the queen reduced to acting as if she lived in public housing? The short answer is that she does live in public housing — just in an exceptionally grand manner. The queen does not own Buckingham Palace; the nation does. It follows that, wealthy as she is, the queen sees no reason to pay for the upkeep of the palace, since she lives there by virtue of her public duties. Behind this tussle over who pays for what is the fundamental ambiguity of a parliamentary democracy headed by a hereditary monarch. This historic anomaly is the key to unraveling the mysteries of the royal finances. It explains how we can have a queen who is privately so very rich, yet who publicly pleads poverty. The modern muddle began in 1760. King George III found himself £3 million in debt — a colossal sum, equivalent to more than £500 million in today’s money. To extricate himself, he surrendered to the government the management of, and revenues from, most of his property. In return, he received a fixed annual payment, known as the Civil List. This was, in essence, how the British government subsidized the royal household for 250 years — until 2012, when Parliament abolished the Civil List and replaced it with the Sovereign Grant. Ostensibly, this was to rationalize the royal finances: The Civil List was the main source of state funding for the royal family, yet it was supplemented by a host of other grants — to cover palace maintenance, communications and travel costs. The Royal Yacht Britannia, for instance, was separately funded to the tune of £11 million a year, until it was retired by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1997 as a cost-cutting measure. The Sovereign Grant was designed to sweep all that away. Rather than the queen’s receiving the Civil List and a suite of subsidies, the level of the grant is simply set at a 15 percent cut of the profits from the Crown Estate. It is a remunerative new arrangement, which projects an income steadily rising to £37.9 million this year, from £36.1 million for 2013. Despite its name, the Crown Estate is a vast property portfolio that belongs to the crown as an embodiment of the state, and not to the reigning monarch as an individual. Among the assets held by the nation that the queen enjoys in her role as the sovereign are Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, the world-renowned royal art collection and the Crown Jewels. The queen could, if she so desired, sell Balmoral Castle tomorrow, as it is her private property. But she could not sell the Crown Jewels; she has no legal title to them. If the monarchy were abolished tomorrow, Buckingham Palace and the royal art collection would, as before, be public property. But the queen would not be obliged — as the humorist Sue Townsend imagined in her 1992 novel “The Queen and I” — to live in a slum: Her personal wealth would enable her to keep company with Russian oligarchs and Saudi royalty indefinitely. The Sovereign Grant seemed to simplify things, but it did nothing to resolve the constitutional fudge. Many within the royal family clearly look upon the Crown Estate as their personal property. And in directly linking royal income to the estate, the grant appeared to some to legitimize the monarch’s claim to it. And there are still hidden subsidies. The Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, for example, are huge property holdings “held in trust” for the sovereign and the heir to the throne, respectively, and are distinct from the Crown Estate. Last year, the queen received £12.7 million from the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Prince of Wales £19.1 million from the Duchy of Cornwall. And both were exempt from business taxes. Such “lost revenues,” argues the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, should be regarded as state handouts to the queen. On this basis, Republic estimates the total cost of the monarchy to the taxpayer is more than £200 million a year. In the background to such a lavish public subsidy of the monarchy is the austerity imposed by the government since 2010, a program that has generated considerable popular anger. There is hostility, too, toward the social privilege of government ministers. Yet, little of this fury has spilled over into outrage about royal funding. Fewer than one in five Britons wants a republic, a figure that has not changed for half a century. In contrast, a poll last year found that 45 percent of the British public showed “strong support” for the monarchy, up from 27 percent in 2006. For royalists, who point to how the economy benefits from tourism through royal pageantry, the monarchy provides value for money. And it is better, they say, to have a nonpolitical head of state who can unite the nation, rather than an elected politician who would divide it. For some, the very idea that M.P.’s should scrutinize the queen’s finances verges on impertinence. Yet the notion of the monarchy as an apolitical institution is preposterous. Its very existence proclaims that an accident of birth matters more than the democratic will. If the royalists have a point, however, it may be this: Their contempt for democracy captures a public mood that is deeply cynical about politicians, who are seen as venal and corrupt. Some suggest that when Queen Elizabeth is eventually replaced by the far less popular Charles, support for the monarchy will plummet. But even when rage at the Windsors was at its height, in the wake of their cack-handed response to the death of Princess Diana in 1997, there was little enthusiasm for a republican alternative. In the past, reverence for the monarchy was rooted in a sense of deference and an acceptance of hierarchy. Today, deference has been replaced by cynicism — but as long as the public despises politicians and favors the royals, one of the richest families in the world will continue to live luxuriously at the taxpayers’ expense.

0,bonnie,tsui,1826,article,"SAN FRANCISCO —  Late last year, a designer and a geographer who met at M.I.T. revealed that they’d spent much of 2013 mapping every single swimming pool in Los Angeles — 43,123 of them, to be exact. Their satellite photos documented all the little aquamarine ovals and rectangles in a huge 74-book project called “The Big Atlas of L.A. Pools.” Though the cultural conversation mostly revolved around how unsettlingly easy it was for them to locate and discover personal details relating to each pool’s owner — address, property value, even sex-offender status — I found myself fantasizing instead about disappearing, and using those pools to do it. What would it be like to follow their hypothetical pool-hopping itinerary and swim freely, from one backyard to another? Submerge yourself, and suddenly you’re under the world’s radar. Each pool, I saw, was in fact a potential portal: a way to shed the noise, to swim to stillness. “Swimming is the ultimate form of sensory deprivation,” Diana Nyad told The New York Times in 2011, describing her attempt to be the first to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage, a feat she finally accomplished last year. “You are left alone with your thoughts in a much more severe way.” This isn’t as bad as it sounds. Ms. Nyad has spent a lifetime in the water, chasing an elusive mark in marathon swimming, and she has written about the exhilarating out-of-body experience she has when powering through long distances. The medium makes it necessary to unplug; the blunting of the senses by water encourages internal retreat. Though we don’t all reach nirvana when we swim, swimming may well be that last refuge from connectivity — and, for some, the only way to find the solitary self. Most days, I get into the neighborhood pool by 8:30 a.m. Even when there’s frost on the ground, the water is warm. Unless you’re the lifeguard, blowing the whistle when you want me to get out, I don’t know you exist. For 60 blessed minutes and 3,200 yards, I’m my only audience. There’s nothing to look at, once the goggles fog over. Sound? The sloshing of water pretty much cancels out everything else. Taste and smell are largely of the chlorine and salt variety (though, at my old pool, I used to smell burgers cooking from the cafe downstairs). Despite all the tech advances of the last few years, you won’t see many swimmers wearing earphones or bone-conduction music devices: They just don’t work that well. We enter the meditative state induced by counting laps, and observe the subtle play of light as the sun moves across the lanes. We sing songs, or make to-do lists, or fantasize about what we’re going to eat for breakfast. Submersion creates the space to be free, to stretch, without having to contend with constant external chatter. It creates internal quiet, too. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of them all, was found to have A.D.H.D. when he was a child; he has called the pool his “safe haven,” in part because “being in the pool slowed down my mind.” In John Cheever’s 1964 short story “The Swimmer,” Neddy Merrill swims home through the backyard pools of his suburban neighbors. To get there, he must navigate the parties and social merriment surrounding every body of water. At one stop, Neddy “stood by the bar for a moment, anxious not to get stuck in any conversation that would delay his voyage. When he seemed about to be surrounded he dove in and swam.” Water, then, is a bubble in which all social pressure is easily eluded. Fifty years later, as the world, with its escalating rings and pings, gets ever more hysterical, suspending yourself in water becomes ever more appealing. For better or worse, the mind wanders: We are left alone with our thoughts, wherever they may take us. A lot of creative thinking happens when we’re not actively aware of it. A recent Carnegie Mellon study shows that to make good decisions, our brains need every bit of that room to meander. Other research has found that problem-solving tends to come most easily when our minds are unfocused, and while we’re exercising. The neurologist Oliver Sacks has written books in his head while swimming. “Theories and stories would construct themselves in my mind as I swam to and fro, or round and round Lake Jeff,” he writes in the essay “Water Babies.” Five hundred lengths in a pool were never boring or monotonous; instead, Dr. Sacks writes, “swimming gave me a sort of joy, a sense of well-being so extreme that it became at times a sort of ecstasy.” The body is engaged in full physical movement, but the mind itself floats, untethered. Beyond this, he adds, “there is all the symbolism of swimming — its imaginative resonances, its mythic potentials.” Dr. Sacks describes a sublime state that is accessible to all, from his father, with his “great whalelike bulk,” who swam daily and elegantly until 94 years of age, to the very young. I recently watched an 8-year-old boy and his teenage sister swim their laps beside me. The boy shivered on land, lips blue and knees knocking. But when he hit the water, he was confident, focused, as fluent in the medium as a seal. For a little while, there was no talk and no tech. Just a boy in his buoyancy. The enforced solitude is at odds with where we are as a culture. Our gyms are full of televisions tuned to SportsCenter and cable news. We’re tethered to our devices, even at bedtime. With that pervasive lack of self-control, who has the willpower to turn off technology for any meaningful period of time? I submit: Sliding into the water is the easiest way to detach from your phone. This is not to say that swimmers are natural Zen masters. Bill Clinton told PBS recently that he and Hillary swim together every afternoon; if either dares to mention a political topic during the course of their swim, he says, “We will stop the other one.” I asked Dara Torres, who has logged countless training hours for her five Olympics, what she thinks about when she’s swimming. “I’m always doing five things at once,” she told me by phone (at the time, she was driving a car). “So when I get in the water, I think about all the things that I have to do. But sometimes I go into a state — I don’t really think about anything.” The important thing, she says, is that the time is yours. “You can use it for anything. It depends where your head is at — it’s a reflection of where you are.” The reflection of where you are: in essence, a status update to you, and only you. The experience is egalitarian. You don’t have to be a great swimmer to appreciate the benefits of sensory solitude and the equilibrium the water can bring. So, quickly now: everybody in the pool. It won’t be long before Google Goggles.

0,eli,finkel,3995,article,"ARE marriages today better or worse than they used to be? This vexing question is usually answered in one of two ways. According to the marital decline camp, marriage has weakened: Higher divorce rates reflect a lack of commitment and a decline of moral character that have harmed adults, children and society in general. But according to the marital resilience camp, though marriage has experienced disruptive changes like higher divorce rates, such developments are a sign that the institution has evolved to better respect individual autonomy, particularly for women. The true harm, by these lights, would have been for marriage to remain as confining as it was half a century ago. As a psychological researcher who studies human relationships, I would like to offer a third view. Over the past year I immersed myself in the scholarly literature on marriage: not just the psychological studies but also work from sociologists, economists and historians. Perhaps the most striking thing I learned is that the answer to whether today’s marriages are better or worse is “both”: The average marriage today is weaker than the average marriage of yore, in terms of both satisfaction and divorce rate, but the best marriages today are much stronger, in terms of both satisfaction and personal well-being, than the best marriages of yore. Consider, for example, that while the divorce rate has settled since the early 1980s at around 45 percent, even those marriages that have remained intact have generally become less satisfying. At the same time, consider the findings of a recent analysis, led by the University of Missouri researcher Christine M. Proulx, of 14 longitudinal studies between 1979 and 2002 that concerned marital quality and personal well-being. In addition to showing that marital quality uniformly predicts better personal well-being (unsurprisingly, happier marriages make happier people), the analysis revealed that this effect has become much stronger over time. The gap between the benefits of good and mediocre marriages has increased. How and why did this divergence occur? In answering this question, I worked with the psychologists Chin Ming Hui, Kathleen L. Carswell and Grace M. Larson to develop a new theory of marriage, which we will publish later this year in a pair of articles in the journal Psychological Inquiry. Our central claim is that Americans today have elevated their expectations of marriage and can in fact achieve an unprecedentedly high level of marital quality — but only if they are able to invest a great deal of time and energy in their partnership. If they are not able to do so, their marriage will likely fall short of these new expectations. Indeed, it will fall further short of people’s expectations than at any time in the past. Marriage, then, has increasingly become an “all or nothing” proposition. This conclusion not only challenges the conventional opposition between marital decline and marital resilience; but it also has implications for policy makers looking to bolster the institution of marriage — and for individual Americans seeking to strengthen their own relationships. TO understand marriage today, it is important to see how we got to where we are. Throughout America’s history, its populace has experienced three distinct models of marriage, as scholars like the sociologist Andrew J. Cherlin and the historian Stephanie Coontz have chronicled. In the era of the institutional marriage, from the nation’s founding until around 1850, the prevalence of individual farming households meant that the main requirements Americans had for their marriage revolved around things like food production, shelter and protection from violence. To be sure, Americans were pleased if they experienced an emotional connection with their spouse, but such affinities were perquisites of a well-functioning marriage rather than its central purpose. In the era of the companionate marriage, from roughly 1850 until 1965, American marriage increasingly centered around intimate needs such as to love, to be loved and to experience a fulfilling sex life. This era overlapped with the shift from rural to urban life. Men increasingly engaged in wage labor outside of the home, which amplified the extent to which the two sexes occupied distinct social spheres. As the nation became wealthier and its social institutions became stronger, Americans had the luxury of looking to marriage primarily for love and companionship. Since around 1965, we have been living in the era of the self-expressive marriage. Americans now look to marriage increasingly for self-discovery, self-esteem and personal growth. Fueled by the countercultural currents of the 1960s, they have come to view marriage less as an essential institution and more as an elective means of achieving personal fulfillment. “You make me want to be a better man,” from the 1997 movie “As Good as It Gets,” could serve as this era’s marriage ideal. In the words of the sociologist Robert N. Bellah, love has become, in good part, “the mutual exploration of infinitely rich, complex and exciting selves.” As a psychologist, I could not help noticing that this history of marriage echoes the classic “hierarchy of needs” outlined in the 1940s by the psychologist Abraham Maslow. According to Maslow, human needs fit into a five-level hierarchy: The lowest need is that of physiological well-being — including the need to eat and drink — followed by the need for safety, then for belonging and love, then for esteem and finally for self-actualization. The emergence of each need characteristically depends on the prior satisfaction of a more basic need. A person unable to satisfy the need for food, for example, is wholly concerned with meeting that need; only once it is met can he focus on satisfying the need above it (safety), and so on. My colleagues and I contend that an analogous process has occurred in our expectations about marriage. Those expectations were set at the low levels of Maslow’s hierarchy during the institutional era, at medium levels during the companionate era and at high levels during the self-expressive era. This historical ascent is, on its own, neither good nor bad. But it has major implications for marital well-being: Though satisfying higher-level needs yields greater happiness, serenity and depth of inner life, people must invest substantially more time and energy in the quality of their relationship when seeking to meet those higher-level needs through their marriage. To be sure, it was no small feat, circa 1800, to produce enough food or keep a house warm, but the effort required to do so did not require deep insight into, and prolonged involvement with, each other’s core essence. As the expectations of marriage have ascended Maslow’s hierarchy, the potential psychological payoffs have increased — but achieving those results has become more demanding. HERE lie both the great successes and great disappointments of modern marriage. Those individuals who can invest enough time and energy in their partnership are seeing unprecedented benefits. The sociologists Jeffrey Dew and W. Bradford Wilcox have demonstrated that spouses who spent “time alone with each other, talking, or sharing an activity” at least once per week were 3.5 times more likely to be very happy in their marriage than spouses who did so less frequently. The sociologist Paul R. Amato and colleagues have shown that spouses with a larger percentage of shared friends spent more time together and had better marriages. But on average Americans are investing less in their marriages — to the detriment of those relationships. Professor Dew has shown that relative to Americans in 1975, Americans in 2003 spent much less time alone with their spouses. Among spouses without children, weekly spousal time declined to 26 hours per week from 35 hours, and much of this decline resulted from an increase in hours spent at work. Among spouses with children at home, spousal time declined to 9 hours per week from 13, and much of this decline resulted from an increase in time-intensive parenting. Though this is not a specifically socioeconomic phenomenon, it does have a socioeconomic dimension. One of the most disturbing facts about American marriage today is that while divorce increased at similar rates for the wealthy and the poor in the 1960s and ’70s, those rates diverged sharply starting around 1980. According to the sociologist Steven P. Martin, among Americans who married between 1975 and 1979, the 10-year divorce rate was 28 percent among people without a high school education and 18 percent among people with at least a college degree: a 10 percentage point difference. But among Americans who married between 1990 and 1994, the parallel divorce rates were 46 percent and 16 percent: an astonishing 30 percentage point difference. The problem is not that poor people fail to appreciate the importance of marriage, nor is it that poor and wealthy Americans differ in which factors they believe are important in a good marriage. The problem is that the same trends that have exacerbated inequality since 1980 — unemployment, juggling multiple jobs and so on — have also made it increasingly difficult for less wealthy Americans to invest the time and other resources needed to sustain a strong marital bond. What can be done? Government actions that reduce inequality and family-friendly work policies like on-site child care are likely to help strengthen marriage. But they are not the only options, particularly for individual couples. First and foremost, couples can choose to invest more time and energy in their marriage, perhaps by altering how they use whatever shared leisure time is available. But if couples lack the time and energy, they might consider adjusting their expectations, perhaps by focusing on cultivating an affectionate bond without trying to facilitate each other’s self-actualization. The bad news is that insofar as socioeconomic circumstances or individual choices undermine the investment of time and energy in our relationships, our marriages are likely to fall short of our era’s expectations. The good news is that our marriages can flourish today like never before. They just can’t do it on their own.",11180,5587,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/sunday/the-all-or-nothing-marriage.html,2014-02-15,The All-or-Nothing Marriage
0,,,14,article,"Last July, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. spoke eloquently of “the importance of the constitutionally protected news gathering process,” the essential role of a free press when it comes to “government accountability and an open society,” and the need to better protect journalists from federal leak investigations. At the time, he described policy revisions that supposedly would achieve those goals, including enhanced oversight by senior Justice Department officials and a new presumption that news organizations would be notified when the government sought their records from phone companies, Internet providers and other third parties. Now, six months later, Mr. Holder says those policies are being followed, but he has yet to actually issue the new guidelines. And, most immediately, he has yet to call off the misguided quest by prosecutors to compel James Risen, a reporter for The Times, who wrote a 2006 book about the Central Intelligence Agency, to reveal a confidential source. Barely a week after Mr. Holder delivered his report to the White House, the Justice Department issued a statement declaring agreement with a chilling 2-to-1 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Virginia, denying the existence of any reporters’ privilege, grounded in the First Amendment, to protect confidential sources in criminal cases. That has been the department’s position on the case from its start to Mr. Risen’s failed appeal in January to the full circuit court. It is sharply at odds with the nearly universal consensus among states that reporters have a common law privilege to protect confidential sources. It also runs counter to the finding by a federal district judge, Leonie Brinkema, and the dissenting appeals judge, Roger Gregory, that the government has ample evidence to proceed with the prosecution without making a reporter give up a source or go to jail. So much for Mr. Holder’s talk of respecting “constitutionally protected” news gathering and not threatening journalists with jail for doing their jobs, except in “extraordinary” circumstances. Mr. Risen has asked the Supreme Court to review his case. But the best resolution would be for Mr. Holder to reconsider Mr. Risen’s subpoena, in keeping with the letter and spirit of his new guidelines. A group of media organizations, including The Times, has been urging just that. It is too late to erase the damage stemming from the Risen case and other egregious attacks on a free press on Mr. Holder’s watch. But reducing the stain on Mr. Holder’s legacy, and building a better legacy, begins with dropping the demand that Mr. Risen testify about his sources.",29,47,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/next-move-on-press-freedom.html,2014-02-15,Next Move on Press Freedom
0,,,16,article,"The chief executive of AOL, Tim Armstrong, was roundly criticized for wrongly connecting the expensive health problems of two babies born to his employees and the health care reform law to the company’s rising health care costs. He eventually apologized for those remarks. Just as wrongheaded was his plan to deal with higher costs by changing the way the company contributes to retirement accounts. AOL, which employs about 5,000 people, said that to compensate for the rising costs of health and other employee benefits it would start contributing to the 401(k) retirement accounts of its employees in one lump sum at the end of the year, instead of every time it pays workers. In doing so, the company was following the example of several large companies, like IBM and Charles Schwab. About 17 percent of employers matched 401(k) contributions in an annual lump sum in 2012, up from 12.9 percent in 2009, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America. It is easy to see why companies are switching to lump-sum contributions: It saves them money. They get to keep until the end of the year the money they would have ordinarily put into workers’ accounts every week or every two weeks. Businesses that choose this approach also get to keep the money that they would have contributed to the retirement accounts of workers who leave for other jobs or are unfortunate enough to be laid off before the end of the year. But these gains come at the expense of working families that face an increasingly insecure retirement. Studies show that most Americans are not putting aside enough money for retirement, and these new 401(k) policies make it that much harder for them to do so. Lump-sum payments expose workers to potentially greater financial risk, because retirement funds that would have been invested in stocks and bonds over the course of a year when companies matched contributions with every paycheck will, under these new policies, be invested all at once at the end of the year. If stocks are rising, as they have been in the last few years, that means the lump sum will be invested in the market when stocks are more expensive than if they were purchased throughout the year. Last Saturday, Mr. Armstrong, along with apologizing, did the right thing in announcing that AOL would reverse the change in its 401(k) policy. Other companies using this kind of contribution approach or considering adopting it should think twice about the damage it does to employee retirement plans.",57,85,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/making-retirements-less-secure.html,2014-02-15,Making Retirements Less Secure
0,,,342,article,"The new Common Core learning standards, which set ambitious goals for what students should learn from one year to the next, are desperately needed in New York, where only about a third of high school students graduate with the math and English skills necessary to succeed at college. But the standards, adopted in 2010, have had a bumpy rollout and are under siege from several constituencies. To keep the momentum going, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Board of Regents, which oversees education in the state, need to resist any effort to roll back the reform. They have to continue to address legitimate criticisms of the way the standards are being put into effect — while also countering the rants of union leaders and other critics who are deliberately misleading the public. The Common Core was little noticed by the general public until August, largely because only last spring did the state shift from its old standardized tests for grades three through eight to ones based on the new learning standards. Scores declined, as expected; only about 31 percent of the state’s students in those grades met or exceeded the new proficiency standard in English language arts, down from about 55 percent the year before. The decline in scores came as a shock to parents in affluent communities, many of whom insisted that the problem lay not in their schools but in the new tests. The State Education Department deserves credit for the inventiveness it showed in creating the new tests and the curriculum materials that support the learning standards. In fact, those materials (instructional videos, teacher training kits and more) are widely used by educators in many other states. New York, however, has failed to explain to parents and communities the aims of the Common Core and that much more would be expected of students, teachers and schools than in the past. To add to the confusion, the state’s 700 districts vary widely in how well they have changed to a new curriculum and trained teachers to execute it. This has created a great deal of anxiety in the teacher corps, not least because the teacher evaluation system required by state law takes student test scores into account. The current situation is made worse by infighting within the state teachers union, which has hardened its anti-Common Core position. The union complains that teachers will be unfairly judged if the new tests are included in their evaluations. But 80 percent of public school teachers will be evaluated entirely based on locally determined measures. Moreover, in last year’s evaluations, which were based partly on the new test scores, only 1 percent of teachers were rated ineffective. The regents this week released a Common Core report in which they recommended allowing teachers to challenge unfair dismissal based on student test scores in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 academic years. This provision would also give the districts time to get the learning standards in place more fully. After Governor Cuomo objected, the regents made the proposal tentative. But the idea makes sense and would make clear to nervous teachers that the state recognizes that the smooth adoption of the new standards will take a bit of time. The regents reiterated that the districts would need more state money to accomplish these reforms, which will also require a larger investment in professional teacher development. Additionally, they voted to require high school students to pass Common Core-based graduation exams at the college-ready level in 2022, instead of 2017, to ensure that all districts would be fully prepared. And despite widespread misconceptions, the regents again explained that the new standards do not require school districts to increase the number of tests. (The scheduled time for the federally required tests in grades three through eight, the Common Core report said, accounted for less than 1 percent of instructional time.) However, local districts themselves have increased testing to comply with a provision of state law created at the request of the unions. The law requires that tests measuring growth in student learning make up 40 percent of an individual teacher’s rating — but half of that must be derived from local measures agreed upon in collective bargaining. To comply, districts have piled on tests, many of which serve only to eat up valuable instructional time. The regents have rightly instructed the districts to cut back on these exams. The rollout of the Common Core standards, which will give students in all districts a better chance at a good education, has not been perfect. But missteps aside, the state cannot afford to let this project founder.",292,322,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/the-common-core-in-new-york.html,2014-02-15,The Common Core in New York
0,joe,nocera,77,article,"Is digital technology destroying middle-class jobs? Does it exacerbate income inequality? Does it boost economic growth and productivity — without creating the jobs that ought to come with economic growth? Last month I gave space to a book titled “Who Owns the Future?” by the computer scientist Jaron Lanier. His answer was an unequivocal yes. He tellingly compared the great photography company of the analog age, Kodak, with the hot photography company of the moment, Instagram. At its peak, Kodak employed 140,000 people; Instagram had only 13 employees when it was bought by Facebook (for $1 billion!) in 2012. Lanier isn’t the only one to have noticed the Kodak-Instagram example. So have Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, two economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose newly published book is titled “The Second Machine Age.” As they put it, “Rapid and accelerating digitization is likely to bring economic rather than environmental disruption, stemming from the fact that as computers get more powerful, companies have less need for some kinds of workers.” In some ways, “The Second Machine Age” is an odd book. For the most part, its tone is one of sunny optimism about all the wonderful things technology will soon bring us, from driverless cars to more powerful forms of artificial intelligence. “Innovation,” they write, is the “most important force that makes our society wealthier.” The authors believe that we are at a moment when technological innovation is about to accelerate, and make the world much wealthier, just as the Industrial Revolution did 250 years ago. Yet buried in their sunny prose is a darker forecast: that while this digital revolution will be great for innovators, entrepreneurs and other creative people, not everyone will participate — especially those who do jobs that software can do better. The authors label the good that technology will do “the bounty.” The downside they call “the spread.” Not everybody buys the technology-is-going-to-change-everything mantra espoused by Brynjolfsson and McAfee. Robert J. Gordon, a macroeconomist at Northwestern University, calls them “techno-optimists.” In his view, the next 40 years of innovation is not going to look much different from the past 40 years, which he believes haven’t been nearly as transformative or wealth-creating as the discovery of electricity and the invention of the light bulb. Unlike Brynjolfsson and McAfee, Gordon believes that economic growth is going to be anemic for years to come, and that, he says, has nothing to do with the rate of technological innovation. Rather, he describes a series of “headwinds” facing the American economy: a stagnant educational system and income inequality, for starters. When I asked him whether future innovation would cost jobs, he said he thought it would, but no more or less than has always been the case. In truth, it is probably too early to know whether this round of technological innovation will ultimately cost or create jobs. The history of innovation has also been a history of job creation — though not necessarily right away. After people figured out how to harness electricity, it took decades before businessmen figured out how to maximize its use in factories. It also required both behavioral and governmental change. People had to abandon farms, move to cities and undertake very different kinds of lives. Factories used children as workers, until governments passed child labor laws. In America, as the country became industrialized, free education became the law of the land. It was one of the greatest policy decisions ever. The authors of “The Second Machine Age” contend that we don’t have to be “tech determinists,” as Brynjolfsson put it when we spoke; we also have the ability to take control of our destiny rather than letting technology take control of us. On Friday, I called Tyler Cowen, the George Mason University economist (and a contributor to The New York Times) to ask what he thought about the relationship between technological innovation and jobs. He told me that he mostly agreed with Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the future, though he disagreed with their assessment of the past. (One of his recent books is titled “The Great Stagnation.”) Yes, he said, technology would replace humans for certain kinds of jobs, but he could also envision growth in the service sector. “The jobs will be better than they sound,” he said. “A lot of them will require skill and training, and will also pay well. I think we’ll get to driverless cars and much better versions of Siri fairly soon,” he added. “That will make the rate of labor force participation go down.” Then he chuckled. He had recently been in a meeting with someone, explaining his views. “So what you’re saying,” the man concluded, “is that the pessimists are right. But it’s going to be much better than they think.”",80,171,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/nocera-innovation-optimism-and-jobs.html,2014-02-15,"Innovation, Optimism and Jobs"
0,doug,glanville,86,article,"Every major league player is deeded real estate in the book of baseball. Some may be granted only one word, others a paragraph. And then there is Derek Jeter, who is closing out, in a masterly way, one of the great chapters in baseball’s history. It is rare when you can craft both the beginning and end of your entry and also guide the pen in between. The serendipity that marks a life in the game can add pages of unforeseen horror (or romance) to your story. The wayward hand of the larger forces in baseball can act like a toddler’s first dance with a crayon. Wantonly scribbling out previous work, recklessly writing outside the lines without control. But a major league player has a magic pen, too. In Jeter’s letter to the fans, he expressed a common player belief that this game was a dream, the domain of the supernatural and unexplainable, enduring against all odds. So you tap your dreams, and accept that every once in a while they will be interrupted by a trip to the disabled list or a subpar season. Yet Jeter lived the daily dream of being an exceptional player with an exceptional organization behind him, and he became one of the best of baseball’s dream. Jeter has built a career on grit and hustle, on an inside-out swing and a jump throw to first from deep in the hole. The ice water in his veins enabled him to expect victory in the most dire circumstances, and doubled as an antidote to the sometimes venomous scrutiny that comes with playing in New York. Jeter has always been daring and fearless, and it takes a lot of courage to pre-empt the inevitable physical decline of a professional baseball player and do what he did this week: declare a self-imposed deadline and submit, finally, to baseball’s history book. The game’s actuarial tables don’t generally put a 40-year-old shortstop in the starting lineup on Opening Day for any contender, so he already enters this season as an anomaly. Yet no player can completely control the ending. Happenstance is one of baseball’s great gifts and curses. When you are playing 162 games in a season, nearly every single day, anything can happen. Jeter never gave up until he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was over, and even then, he winked. He is pragmatic and knows the risk of entering a season at this stage in his career without a plan: it’s an invitation to chaos. There would be the inevitable questions about a slow bat or an unhealed ankle, the distractions and self-doubts that come with a slump at 40 versus a slump at 25. In many ways, Jeter’s declaration not only provided parameters for himself, it spared his teammates and his manager. They will not have to explain his future struggles, they will not have to consider joining a conversation that suggests he think about retirement. Truth is, he does not know how this year will unfold. We can imagine the impossible — like a standing ovation in his honor at Fenway Park or a game-winning home run in Game 7 of the World Series — because all along he played for something bigger than rivalry and organizational pride. Those priorities earn the respect of anyone who loves the game and cares about its future. Jeter transcended tried-and-true constructs, and it would be fitting if his transition from the game were transcendent. But even though Jeter’s baseball legacy will be there for all time, the world changes, and how that legacy is interpreted will change with it. This is what is so hard. Even if we end on our terms, we still can’t know how we will be remembered. We hope there is something immutable about our effort. That we are somehow timeless and forever. But we have to wait and see, and clarity still might not come in our lifetime. As Jeter stated in his letter to his fans, “Now it is time for a new chapter. I have new dreams and aspirations, and I want new challenges.” His greatest challenge may be those first steps without the pinstripes, without the packed stadium, without the opponent 60 feet 6 inches away. It might arise while he’s sitting on the couch, opening up baseball’s history and seeing his entry complete, with nothing more to be added. But the good news, as baseball turns to the next chapter, is that it’s a game that looks forward and backward equally, and something tells me that Derek Jeter will be that rarity who will find a way to travel through time and stand in both the past and in the future.",145,160,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/glanville-the-book-on-jeter.html,2014-02-15,The Book on Jeter
0,marie,lee,1034,article,"I HAVE never had a mammogram. I’m almost 50 — nearly a decade into the age when the screening is recommended by the American Cancer Society. I’m college educated, adequately insured. And I am the bane of my health care providers. Once, my midwife went so far as to request that I never speak of my decision in any space where other patients might hear. This week, I was vindicated. On Tuesday, a Canadian study, one of the largest ever done on mammograms, was published in the British Medical Journal. The study found that mammograms did not reduce breast cancer deaths in women around my age compared to physical exams, and that one in five women screened was overdiagnosed, possibly leading to unnecessary surgery or radiation. It seems astonishing, but it reinforced what smaller studies had told me, as someone with no family history of breast cancer: that getting a mammogram was unlikely to affect my chances of dying from the disease. What it would do is increase the probability of my mistakenly becoming a breast-cancer patient. When I was in my late 30s, my midwife suggested I get a baseline mammogram, followed by annual screenings. I was ready to do it. I assumed my research into it would be mere due diligence. This kind of research was a new habit of mine, born of necessity. When our son was 18 months old, he developed a devastating tumor on his spinal cord. We waited for the doctors to tell us what to do, but the diagnoses and suggestions were scattered — it’s cancer, it’s not cancer, it’s half cancerous, we need radiation, we don’t need radiation, it’s life-threatening, it’s benign. We opted for surgery, and it was deemed a success. Doctors waved us out of the hospital with balloons. But a few weeks later, we were urgently summoned back. The oncologists had decided that he needed another operation to make sure they had removed all of the tumor.  It made me realize that, despite the surety with which the medical professionals had presented things, it was all a best guess based on the available information. So I started doing my own research, to try to make the best decisions for our baby. I soon began to wonder why I didn’t study my own health care decisions as thoroughly as I did his. So I started looking into mammograms. The more I found, the more I doubted. I was stunned by a 2001 Cochrane review — considered to be the gold standard for evidence-based studies — that concluded, “The currently available reliable evidence has not shown a survival benefit of mass screening for breast cancer.” Everywhere, I saw pink ribbons and the message that mammograms save lives. But no matter how many times I read the numbers, I wasn’t convinced that I should get one. Over the years, my choice has spurred concern from health care practitioners as well as the person who is most worried about my health: my mother, who, in her 80s, is still a religious mammogrammer. She has described how nerve-racking the post-procedure waiting room is — you shiver in the cooled air until you’re sent home or get the ominous “The doctor needs to talk to you.” One day a few years ago, she was the one called to stay. They had found something “suspicious,” and she felt her world falling apart. When my mother told me this, the first thing I thought of was the high rates of over- and misdiagnoses, and I told her so. But she still spent over a month in a panic — waiting for the follow-up, which then was somehow done incorrectly and had to be repeated one more time. Finally, multiple painful mammograms later, they concluded it had all been a mistake. And oddly, the false urgency has continued: She has been getting notices reminding her to make an appointment for another mammogram in six months because she is now “high-risk.” Patients want reassurances. We feel we have to test, so we can find out if we’re sick. We rarely consider that the test itself might make us sick — perhaps through repeated exposure to radiation — or that there are health advantages for the nontester like me, who gains time, sheds stress and potentially dodges the harm of a false positive or unnecessary treatment. This isn’t the answer for everyone. But as parents and patients, we have no choice but to try to become conversant in medicine, even if it makes some doctors bristle. Our medical experts are an invaluable resource, but in the end, it’s up to each of us how we want to proceed. I now have a new primary care physician who still refers me to the mammography center, but when he hands me the slip, he smiles and says, “But I suspect you won’t do it,” and I get the feeling he respects my reasons. I wonder if, some day in the not too distant future, he’ll say, “This test actually seems to have more risks than rewards,” and stop handing out that slip at all.",926,594,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/why-i-never-got-a-mammogram.html,2014-02-15,Why I Never Got a Mammogram
0,nicholas,dawidoff,37,article,"WHEN the football star Michael Sam, the all-American University of Missouri defensive end, came out this week, it meant that he might become the first openly gay N.F.L. player. In many ways football is the game of our time, but definitely not on this topic. For more than a year I spent most of my waking hours inside the New York Jets facility while writing a book about life in the N.F.L. and, at times, found the atmosphere intensely homophobic. I’d hear people talking about Omar, the shotgun-wielding stickup man on the TV show “The Wire,” how he’d been their favorite character until they learned he was gay and how they couldn’t watch the show anymore. During training camp there were bumper-sticker pranks carried out in the parking lot during which players’ vehicles were adorned with messages like “I Stop for Gay Bars.” When the coaches evaluated practice or game film, if they saw something objectionable, they might dismiss it as “gay porn.” It was the regressive old American notion of homosexuality as something mysterious, alien and predatory. What were these big, strong men so afraid of? Partly, they were work-obsessed people who never interacted with openly gay colleagues on the job. But it also cut to the cultural essence of the game. Football is a dangerous sport run as a ruthless business. More than ever, on any given Sunday, any team can win. Annual roster turnover is drastic: N.F.L., the players say — Not For Long. And yet every coach who wants to succeed in such a competitive business needs to build a sense of team purpose, to encourage players to subordinate themselves to the mutual endeavor. It works because, as is true in the military, the players feel a primary commitment and personal devotion to their leaders and peers. Other major sports have frequent games; an N.F.L. team’s entire regular-season playing time is 16 hours long. Most of the football existence is men sitting around in small meeting rooms. To encourage the immersion, the facility provides all the comforts of home; meals are cooked, your car is washed. It really is intimate. Players and coaches spoke often of their deep affection for one other. Many players came from single-parent families, and to some of them, football’s chief attraction was that it provided surrogates: “Football is my father,” one player told me. What retired players and coaches say they miss most is not the playing, but the camaraderie — having all those loving men around every day. Love was a word I heard used frequently in regard to teammates and coaches. The very nature of football, focused as it is on strength, virility, grace and manly bonding, has an obvious homoerotic component for those who play and for those who watch. Part of the reason homosexuality is anathema in football, the reason gay players hide their sexual identity and fear rumors will keep them from getting drafted, is the worry that the affection could go too far and force the rest of the team to confront something uncomfortable in their bonds. Michael Sam’s Missouri teammates knew he was gay long before the public did. They revered him as a person and they respected his privacy by keeping his secret. Think about that — all those college players maintaining such an explosive confidence, and in the age of social media, no less. If Mr. Sam joins an N.F.L. team, that team can expect abundant media interest. Football teams are chary of anything that will divert attention from the mission at hand. To maintain the comity and the conformity, unofficial N.F.L. policy holds that you never discuss politics, religion or wives. Surely Mr. Sam knew that, but he revealed his sexuality because he understood that persistent rumors he was gay were harming his future. And while he’s obviously aware that his pioneering status will attract scrutiny, he’s emphasized that now that his secret is out, all he wants to do is succeed at an enormously difficult profession. For him, the secret was the distraction.  Later this month, Mr. Sam will be interviewed and perform drills at the N.F.L.’s scouting combine in Indianapolis. By the so-called measurables, he is undersized for an N.F.L. defensive lineman and slow for a pass-rushing linebacker. But N.F.L. executives will tell you that the most coveted qualities among viable college players are character and desire. In that respect, it seems difficult to bet against this player, who has demonstrated unusual public courage and has something significant to prove. During my time with the Jets, a particularly savvy coach once asked me if I considered football people to be the worst homophobes I’d ever met. I said that it seemed to me that while football’s was a homophobic culture, the sport’s history was the eventual acceptance of anybody who could help a team win. When that happened with a gay player, I could imagine his teammates making up the wedding party at his marriage. The coach agreed and said that football right now was homophobic, but as soon as good players who were also gay players began identifying themselves as such, the sport would embrace them. In a day of concussions, bounties and bullying, football could use such a transformative moment.",94,102,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/footballs-loving-culture.html,2014-02-15,Football’s Loving Culture
0,eric,weinberger,21,article,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Whenever the first serious snowfall arrives in the Alps, it is soon followed by the Netherlands’ first “gipsvlucht” — “gips” means plaster, of the sort used in casts, while “vlucht” is flight — of the season, carrying aching, broken Dutch skiers. This year, as usual, the news teams were out in force covering the special airlift as it arrived in Rotterdam from Innsbruck, Austria, on Dec. 28. It was the first of many. Europeans from every country love to ski, but the Dutch flatlanders have an outsize love for the slopes. With the country’s highest elevation at 1,059 feet — which isn’t even fully their own, being shared at the border with Belgium and Germany — they have to travel the farthest for decent skiing. In the seaside dunes of the town where I grew up, just north of The Hague, there was a short pine needle ski course of no discernible drop. We could make up for it only by traveling 600 miles to the Alps for a precious week of skiing during the school holidays. And yet in the 2014 Olympics, for the first time, a Dutch person — Nicolien Sauerbreij, from the town of De Hoef, a few feet below sea level — will be defending her title as champion in a downhill event, having won gold in the parallel giant slalom snowboarding event in 2010. Leading the way uphill is the Dutch royal family, who, as every Dutch person knows, has taken an annual ski holiday in the Austrian village of Lech since shortly after World War II. By common agreement, except for one photo session at the beginning of the vacation week, the paparazzi leave them alone. (In 2012, the holiday ended in tragedy, when the king’s brother, Prince Johan Friso, was buried in an avalanche, putting him in a coma from which he never emerged; he died of complications in August.) Still, nothing stops Dutch people from skiing. In 2012, while the country was still struggling through recession, nearly one million (out of a population of almost 17 million) traveled to the Alps. They descend en masse on Alpine resorts, most of them Austrian; some fly or travel by train, but most drive. The beginning of the February week that the Dutch schools are off is known for some of the longest traffic jams in Europe. Even worse, in the opinion of other skiers, not all of them natives, are Dutch children, the most poorly behaved among Alpine tourists, known for pranks like shouting at skiers from chairlifts, trying to startle them into falling. Of course, globalization has made everything more accessible to everyone, including gold medals for snow sports. Improved travel, coaching and sponsorships have produced, in the 21st century, that remarkable thing, a Dutch snowboarding champion. Scandinavians and alpine countries and North Americans still dominate, but one no longer has to be born in a wintry climate to compete. In the next decades there will, undoubtedly, be a South African medalist in skiing, or a medal-winning Brazilian snowboarder. But if the globalized world is disorienting, the Dutch had a handle on it centuries ago. Their country is tiny, with a lot of people living on unstable, often reclaimed land. Since the days of the Dutch East India Company, they have looked outward for everything they couldn’t get at home. It made them rich and, for a time, among the world’s greatest sea powers. The Dutch pursuit of a recreation like skiing should be seen in a similar light. Mountains are massive, and yet snow can be unstable underfoot just like water. Skiing brings the Dutch out of themselves, the mountains being familiar and yet different. More important, they are far away — which, as the Dutch have demonstrated throughout their history, is no obstacle, just an excellent challenge.  Eric Weinberger  is a freelance writer.

0,antony,shugaar,215,article,"In the run-up to this Sunday’s election for governor of Sardinia, there was a noteworthy exchange between the incumbent governor and the third-place candidate, Michela Murgia, a dark-horse independent not widely expected to win. Sharp clashes are typical in the homestretch of any election, and this one will determine the direction that Sardinia, an autonomous island region with a distinctive culture and identity, takes in the next five years. Proposals are on the table to establish a business-friendly tax-free zone, and the incumbent governor is on trial for malfeasance. But most important of all, this uneven three-way contest pits Ugo Cappellacci, an incumbent member of Silvio Berlusconi’s newly refounded Forza Italia party, against Francesco Pigliaru, a representative of the center-left Democratic Party, who is tailing him closely, and Ms. Murgia, a long-shot scrappy outsider. Ms. Murgia, a best-selling novelist and first-time political candidate, used her Facebook page to denounce Mr. Cappellacci, as the “Schettino of Sardinian politics.” Schettino is a name instantly recognizable to any Italian, and one that Americans will need only slight prompting before muttering, “Oh, that guy.” He is the former captain of the cruise ship Costa Concordia now facing trial for abandoning the sinking vessel; in this exchange, Ms. Murgia becomes that other guy, the Italian Coast Guard captain who famously shouted for Captain Schettino to get back on the ship. What Ms. Murgia was saying with her comparison was, “Allow me to take the helm.” It was unquestionably a harsh attack, especially given the election’s island setting, where ships are a crucial lifeline. Moreover, there is an abiding strain of Sardinian exceptionalism. This island may officially be a part of Italy, but it thinks of itself as a separate nation. It has given Italy notable figures, both political and literary: the political thinker Antonio Gramsci, the Nobel laureate Grazia Deledda (the second woman to win the prize for literature), the Communist Party leader Enrico Berlinguer and the departing prime minister, Enrico Letta (on his mother’s side). In a very real way, Sardinia is Italy’s Ireland, right down to its intense and colorful politicking. Still, it was the governor’s response that stood out. Asked about it on a political shock-jock radio show, he replied, “It’s odd that she, who is the Costa Concordia of politics, should call me Schettino.” Questioned further by one of the two bantering moderators, Mr. Cappellacci explained the reference: “Well, first of all, when it comes to tonnage, she’s certainly got it all.” Though it’s a radio show, there’s video footage, and immediately after the governor’s response two female musicians in the background did almost simultaneous head-rolls and grimaces. Italy at large had much the same reaction: Il Corriere della Sera, one of the country’s largest papers, referred to a political atmosphere that was “decisamente non oxfordiano” — certainly not the climate of an Oxford debate. To reply to accusations of political cowardice and incompetence by calling one’s accuser fat struck more than one observer as typical of the Forza Italia style, and I believe it is no accident that Mr. Cappellacci has recently abandoned the rebellious Angelino Alfano-led wing of the Berlusconi movement and moved closer to Il Cavaliere, as Berlusconi was long known. (“Il Cavaliere” means “knight” and refers to the conferring of “knighthoods” of industry in Italy; since the term also connotes chivalry, it seems to have been retired among all the bunga bunga lewdness of recent years.) As the election takes place, Mr. Berlusconi is facing a new trial for bribing a political opponent. Ms. Murgia is a successful writer (her first novel, “The World Needs to Know,” is based on her own experiences working in a call center and was made into a movie) who has told her book editor — to that editor’s chagrin — that her first love is politics. Interestingly, polls show that while the incumbent governor leads in name recognition, Ms. Murgia is first in voter trust. Unfortunately, name recognition is likely to beat trust, hands down. As is so often the case in Italy, behind the dust-up are issues that are both real and anything but clear-cut. Mr. Cappellacci was fined nearly $15 million for starting a Sardinian state-owned fleet of ferry boats offering service to the mainland; the four leading ferry fleets were also fined a similar amount for price gouging. But it was the decidedly non-Oxfordian style of Mr. Cappellacci’s attack that, fines and malfeasance aside, seemed to prompt the most indignation. Still, perhaps one of the most important points has to do with the island’s most famous resident. Like the Medici, who were great patrons of the arts but also plutocrats and dictators, Mr. Berlusconi does a great deal of his political business out of his homes, one of which is outside Milan and another — an opulent vacation place — is on Sardinia. And it is this promiscuous mixing of personal and political power that is so subtly subversive. If Mr. Cappellacci wins and Mr. Berlusconi is confined to house arrest, as seems very likely, will the governor of Sardinia become the former prime minister’s accommodating prison warden?

0,,,188,article,"Swiss voters have handed the populist right in Europe an alarming victory. On Sunday, Feb. 9, voters approved an anti-immigration referendum that effectively rejects one of the defining principles of modern Europe: the free movement of European citizens within the Continent. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but, in 2008, it accepted participation in the Schengen Agreement, a Pan-European accord that allows Europeans to move freely across borders. Switzerland’s business community had warned that the anti-immigration measure would harm the country’s economy and threaten Swiss jobs. But its argument failed to dissuade enough people, with the measure supported by 50.3 percent of those voting. Leaders of the European Union, which must now review its relationship with Switzerland, condemned the vote, as did the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Their governments, and others in Europe, must now review existing bilateral agreements with Switzerland that allow citizens to live and work in each other’s countries. The right-wing People’s Party was the driving force behind the measure, warning that an influx of foreigners is threatening to overwhelm Swiss identity. Parties across Europe, as well as the British government of David Cameron, are blaming immigration for a range of economic and social woes; immigration from poorer to richer countries has increased in recent years in tandem with Europe’s economic crisis. Citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, neither of which is well-off, gained the right to move freely in the European Union at the beginning of this year, triggering more alarmist anti-immigrant rhetoric. France’s right-wing National Front party was quick to praise the Swiss vote. The party is expected to be a big winner in European parliamentary elections scheduled for May. Anti-immigrant parties in the Netherlands, Austria and Scandinavia are also doing well. The Swiss vote is likely to give them a boost. The European right couples anti-immigrant fear-mongering with the promise of a nostalgic return to an idealized Europe of homogeneous national populations purged of unwanted foreigners. That kind of false nostalgia, part of the run-up to World War II, was a big reason the European Union was created in the first place. One can only hope that the reality of what this vote could cost the Swiss will serve as a wake-up call for other Europeans.",53,61,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/false-nostalgia-in-switzerland.html,2014-02-15,False Nostalgia in Switzerland
0,gratiane,de moustier,341,article,"Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, a 23-year-old Indonesian maid, returned to her home province of Java from Hong Kong last month hardly able to walk. Cuts and burns covered most of her body. Her employer in Hong Kong allegedly beat her and locked her up for weeks. Each year hundreds of thousands of young Indonesian women like Ms. Erwiana fan out across Asia and the Middle East to live in the homes of local people and serve as their domestic helpers — cooking, cleaning and caring for children and the elderly. Most send a portion of their salary home to their families every month, fueling an Indonesian economy that relies on remittances. More than 320,000 foreign domestic helpers live in Hong Kong, a city of seven million people, and close to half of them come from Indonesia. Although Hong Kong has better legal protections for foreign domestic helpers than other Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia, the laws that govern their living and working conditions are discriminatory and foster an environment that can lead to abuse. Ms. Erwiana was by no means the first victim in Hong Kong of a horrible beating, and unless changes are made to the law, she won’t be the last. The most restrictive requirement on foreign maids in Hong Kong is the so-called live-in law, which requires that the guest workers reside with their employers. Many employers give maids small windowless closets for bedrooms, and sometimes worse. The live-in rule means that maids are often on call 24 hours a day. And maids with abusive employers have few places to go or people they can turn to for help. The minimum wage for foreign maids in Hong Kong — a flat rate of $517 per month — works out to be significantly lower than it is for locals, which is about $3.85 per hour. By paying foreign maids much less for longer working hours, Hong Kong has, in effect, created an underclass of foreign female laborers. The women who take care of Hong Kong’s children and elderly are on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder. And while the legal code is flawed, it is also often flouted. Many employers and placement agents hold maids’ travel documents to prevent them from leaving the territory without permission. They are often paid less than the minimum wage and forced to work seven days a week. Thousands of maids each year file complaints with the Hong Kong Labor Department over contract disputes. A survey by the Mission for Migrant Workers, a nongovernmental organization, reported in 2013 that some 18 percent of maids said they were physically abused by their employers. Yet thousands of women still migrate to Hong Kong, appreciative of the opportunity to earn money that wouldn’t be available to them at home. This workforce of women contributes significantly to their home-country economies: All foreign workers from the Philippines, the other main source of maids in Hong Kong, sent $24 billion home in 2012, while Indonesians sent home an estimated $7.1 billion. My work as a photojournalist took me to Indonesia and Hong Kong between November 2012 and February 2013 to investigate the recruitment of Indonesian domestic helpers and the conditions in which they live in Hong Kong. I spoke with many domestic workers and while some seemed content, a shocking number told of misery and abuse. Lista, 26, was excited to start her new job in Hong Kong when I spoke with her there in November 2012. But after talking about how much she was looking forward to the money, she said, almost jokingly, that living conditions in Hong Kong are not always good. Her sister had to resign as a maid in order to leave the tiny nook in which she was sleeping: a windowless pantry. She also talked, not without horror, about her friend who was forced to sleep on her employer’s dining room table once they had all gone to bed. While the Hong Kong legal system and abusive employers are to blame for many of the hardships maids face in the Chinese territory, the situation is more complex. Indonesia’s government and private business people actively support this flawed system. In Indramayu, a town in West Java, Indonesia, I met Bunda Pitrin and her husband Milyanto, who were brokers for domestic-helper recruitment agencies. They sell the dream of a better life abroad to young female villagers and their families. Each maid they send to a recruitment center in Jakarta brings them around $685. They promise 30 percent to the woman’s family, to encourage them to let her leave home. Yayu Rolya Subandiyah, 26, arrived in Hong Kong in August 2012. Before moving, she had spent six months in a training center in Java, a requirement of the Indonesian government, where she was taught the basics of cooking, cleaning and some English and Cantonese. Like all of her compatriots, she had to pay back the fees for the training classes. When maids arrive in Hong Kong, most women are forced to relinquish a large part of their salary each month to repay the cost of the training back home. This ties them to their new jobs in Hong Kong, and makes it more difficult for them to leave when the situation is bad. In Ms. Yayu’s case, things quickly became complicated with her employer. During her second week on the job, her employer, in a fit of rage, threw some cleaning product into her eyes. She fled out of fear. Her first instinct was to seek refuge with her placement agency, but she found that the agents there did not want to know about her troubles, and she was encouraged to return to her employer. By creating conditions that keep Indonesian women tied to their debts, while limiting their movements and underpaying them, the Indonesian and Hong Kong governments and the recruiters force maids into a form of indentured servitude. The people of Hong Kong should demand that their government rectify the legal discrimination and provide more protections for their domestic workers. And Indonesians should do their part to reshape the recruitment system so foreign worker safety and dignity come before profits.

0,,,30,article,"The decision by the United States to have its ambassador to India, Nancy Powell, meet Narendra Modi, a star of the country’s Bharatiya Janata opposition party, reversed a long estrangement. It was a pragmatic step in engaging with India and the controversial and troubling politician who could well become the next prime minister after elections in May. In 2005, the United States imposed a visa ban on Mr. Modi, who is the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, over questions about his role in the savage riots there in 2002 that left nearly 1,000 people dead, most of them part of the Muslim minority. Many Indians felt that Mr. Modi should have done more to stop the violence; some even said he was complicit. Mr. Modi has denied any wrongdoing, and in 2012 a Supreme Court investigative team declined to bring charges, saying there wasn’t enough evidence. In December, a court in Gujarat drew a similar conclusion. The Obama administration this week said the visa status remains the same, but it seems likely that could change, especially if Mr. Modi becomes prime minister. His rise to power is deeply troubling to many Indians, especially the country’s 138 million Muslims and its many other minorities. His strident Hindu nationalism and inability to tolerate dissent could inflame sectarian tensions that have subsided somewhat in the last decade. That would be destructive for India and the region. Should he become prime minister, his ability to reverse a decline in economic growth, India’s greatest challenge, and to ensure stability would depend on his ability to represent, and defend, all the country’s people. The meeting with Ms. Powell was part of a renewed American effort to reach out to politicians across India’s political spectrum. Such moves are long overdue. President Obama has not paid as much attention to India as President George W. Bush, a serious oversight given India’s central role as a democratic anchor in South Asia and its developing relationship with Japan. Since 2008 when India and the United States completed a pathbreaking nuclear energy agreement, they have worked to develop closer commercial and strategic ties and now share almost $100 billion in annual trade. But the relationship is under serious strains, including a trade dispute over solar panels and a row over a diplomat who was charged with visa fraud and illegally underpaying her maid and left the United States in January. It is in no one’s interest to let these tensions fester. India and the United States have much to cooperate on, including Mr. Obama’s efforts to strengthen America’s role in Asia and work with partners there to balance China’s rise and more assertive stance in the region without provoking conflict. In addition, India, like the United States, is deeply worried about a potential takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban once American troops leave and any potential spillover in nuclear-armed Pakistan. Regardless of who succeeds Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this year, the United States and India have a lot of work to do to strengthen their partnership. Opening a door to a relationship with Mr. Modi is a necessary step.",62,86,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/more-engagement-with-india.html,2014-02-14,More Engagement With India
0,,,2,article,"Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday released a preliminary budget, his first, that surprised some fiscal watchdogs with its moderation and caution. It doesn’t break the bank on “progressive” agenda items. It restores $1 billion to a depleted trust fund for retiree health benefits and doubles, to $600 million, reserves set aside each year for unexpected shortfalls. The nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission called it a “double dose of good news” that projected revenues are higher than expected, and that Mr. de Blasio is proposing to sock some money away. But a February budget is a negotiating position, not the final product. We have not yet seen pushback from Mr. de Blasio’s progressive allies in the City Council, who will want to spend more on an array of causes, and from the unions that are demanding billions in back pay and raises from long-expired contracts. Mr. de Blasio’s $73.7 billion spending plan also assumes $530 million from higher taxes on the well-off to pay for prekindergarten and after-school programs — revenue that still counts as imaginary, given stiff resistance in Albany. In the reality-based portions of the budget, some things look good. Mr. de Blasio wants to relieve the New York City Housing Authority of its $52.5 million bill for policing services, freeing that money up for much-needed repairs. He has budgeted an additional $35 million for snow removal this winter, acknowledging the burdens of the ongoing deep freeze. There are new liabilities, like an inspector general for the Police Department, expanded paid sick leave and municipal ID cards, and the mayor has restored $59 million to undo the closing of 20 fire companies and nearly $10 million for the budgets of the public advocate and borough presidents. Except for the pre-K program, however, these proposals are relatively modest. It’s widely believed that in replenishing the retiree health trust fund, the mayor is simply parking money there for use in future labor negotiations. In addition, he wasn’t specific about where the money for new contracts would come from, beyond warning the unions of the obvious, that “we are going to need cost savings and efficiencies.” But the Citizens Budget Commission, also stating the obvious, reminded the mayor that the city’s unfunded liability for its retirees, mostly from health care, is a staggering $92.5 billion. It urged that the trust fund not be plundered for budget balancing, and that strict conditions be set on how that money is spent. Although months of negotiations lie ahead before a final budget, Mr. de Blasio pointedly rejected what he called the annual “Kabuki” ritual between the mayor and City Council over proposed cuts that always loom but never happen. And he reminded his listeners that he had inherited the unresolved contracts from his predecessor. So he did. But they are his contracts now. His early budget plan puts him in a good position heading into challenging negotiations with the unions, whose cooperation he will need to make the budget work, for real.",2,11,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/a-first-stab-at-a-prudent-city-budget.html,2014-02-14,A First Stab at a Prudent City Budget
0,,,235,article,"Regulators might be tempted to agree with Comcast that its proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion in stock poses no threat to competition and would actually benefit consumers by giving the company more resources to invest in new services. But government officials should not accept that argument without conducting a thorough investigation into what effect a merger between the country’s two largest cable companies would have on the media and the Internet. Comcast’s chief executive, Brian Roberts, on Thursday said that his company and Time Warner Cable do not operate in the same ZIP codes. But the issue with cable mergers is not that they reduce or eliminate head-to-head competition for subscribers, because most cities have just one cable provider. This deal is important because it would give Comcast greater power over media companies like CBS and Disney and Internet services like Netflix and Amazon. And that would ultimately give it more control over American consumers. If the government approves this deal, Comcast will operate in 43 of the 50 largest metropolitan markets, and will have about 30 percent of the national pay television subscribers and about one-third of all broadband Internet subscribers. Because it would control such a large chunk of the country, Comcast would have significant leverage in contract negotiations with media companies over what TV channels cable companies are willing to carry and how much they pay for them. Such contract talks have become increasingly acrimonious in recent years. For example, in August Time Warner Cable temporarily pulled CBS programing from its cable systems in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas because the two companies couldn’t agree on the terms of a new contract. The merger could also strengthen Comcast’s position in its dealings with businesses like Netflix that send data to customers over broadband connections. Representatives for cable and phone companies have argued that content companies should pay them fees to transport movies and online video on top of the monthly charges individuals pay for Internet access. A recent federal appeals court decision made it easier for cable and phone companies to demand such payments by striking down Federal Communications Commission rules that required broadband providers to treat all Internet content alike. Generally speaking, antitrust regulators are most worried about mergers that create monopolies that can raise the prices of goods and services when customers have few or no other choices. But officials should be just as concerned about deals that turn a business into a dominant buyer that can make or break its suppliers. An all-powerful cable company, for example, would be able to influence and control what Americans could watch or read by refusing to carry channels or certain Internet services, or it could favor its own content. Comcast, for example, might find it tempting to treat programming from NBC Universal, which it owns, better than shows from rival networks and movie studios. Officials at the antitrust division of the Department of Justice and the F.C.C., who have spoken recently about the importance of competition in the increasingly concentrated communications industry, need to study this deal closely. If they find that the merger would give Comcast too much power, the agencies can demand that the company make significant divestments (Comcast has offered to divest three million customers to get regulators to look upon the deal favorably) or they could sue to block the acquisition altogether.",236,320,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/if-a-cable-giant-becomes-bigger.html,2014-02-14,If a Cable Giant Becomes Bigger
0,david,brooks,129,article,"In 2005, Michael Ignatieff left a teaching job at Harvard to enter politics in his native Canada with hopes of becoming prime minister. He quickly came to understand how politics is different from academia. In academia, you use words to persuade or discover; in politics, you use words to establish a connection. Academia is a cerebral enterprise, but politics is a physical enterprise, a charismatic form of athletics in which you touch people to show you care. In academia, the goal is to come up with a timeless truth. In politics, timing is everything, knowing when the time is ripe for a certain proposal. In academia, the idea is to take a stand based on what you believe; in politics, the idea is to position yourself along a left-right axis in a way that will differentiate you from your opponents and help you win a majority. In academia, a certain false modesty is encouraged; in politics, you have to self-dramatize a fable about yourself — concoct a story to show how your life connects to certain policies. In academia, you are rewarded for candor, intellectual rigor and a willingness to follow an idea to its logical conclusion. In politics, all of these traits are ruinous. Naturally, Ignatieff found the transition to politics more difficult than he imagined. He started his career well enough. He was elected to Parliament. Within a year, he was a deputy party leader and, within a few years, he was leader of Canada’s Liberal Party. But he was in over his head and the victim of inexorable historical trends. He was not an effective opposition leader. In his first national election, he and his party were crushed. Ignatieff even lost his own parliamentary seat. It was a humiliating failure, which ended his political career. Fortunately, he did not return with empty hands. His memoir, “Fire and Ashes: Success and Failure in Politics,” is the best book about what it feels like to be a politician since Richard Ben Cramer’s “What It Takes.” Ignatieff was first invited to run for office by some backstage power brokers, even though he hadn’t lived in his country for 30 years. He agreed but wasn’t initially sure why he wanted to do it beyond some vague sense that it would honor his parents. He was betrayed by old friends. He endured unearned and lofty condescension from political columnists. In Parliament, he became a total partisan, putting, as one must, loyalty to the group above loyalty to truth. He had no friends who were not in his own party. He loathed the other side. “We never wasted a single breath trying to convince each other of anything,” he recalls. He learned that when you are attacking your opponent, you have to hit his strengths because his weaknesses will take care of themselves. Political discourse, he came to see, is not really a debate about issues; it is a verbal contest to deny your opponents of standing, or as we would say, legitimacy. “Of the three elections that I fought, none was a debate on the country’s future. All were vicious battles over standing.” During the course of his career he endured the character tests that all honest politicians face. “Politics tests your capacity for self-knowledge more than any profession I know,” he writes. He would look at himself in the mirror, wearing the suits that the image crafters had selected, and feel as though he had been taken over by some strange new persona he barely recognized. He went through each day completely dependent on the reaction of other people, minute by minute, second by second, to validate his performance. After poor showings at question time, he’d go to the washroom, no longer sure he was up to the job, confronting the mistakes that suggested he wasn’t. “I had never been so well-dressed in my life and had never felt so hollow.” But Ignatieff ultimately delivers a strong defense of politics. Politicians should never imagine themselves superior to the process they are engaged in. Politicians bind people together into communities and nations, he argues. To be a politician is to be “worldly and sinful and yet faithful and fearless at the same time. You put your own immodest ambitions in the service of others. You hope that your ambitions will be redeemed by the good you do.” Politics, as Max Weber famously said, is the necessary work of strong and slow boring through hard boards. People who do it out of a sense of selfishness and vanity, often give up, because the life can be miserable. The people who sustain are usually motivated by a sense of service, and by evidence of the good that laws and programs can do. Ignatieff failed at politics, but through the refiner’s fire of the political climb, he realized what a tainted but worthwhile calling it can be.",245,248,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/brooks-the-refiners-fire.html,2014-02-14,The Refiner’s Fire
0,paul,krugman,1427,article,"Now that the Congressional Budget Office has explicitly denied saying that Obamacare destroys jobs, some (though by no means all) Republicans have stopped lying about that issue and turned to a different argument. O.K., they concede, any reduction in working hours because of health reform will be a voluntary choice by the workers themselves — but it’s still a bad thing because, as Representative Paul Ryan puts it, they’ll lose “the dignity of work.” So let’s talk about what that means in 21st-century America. It’s all very well to talk in the abstract about the dignity of work, but to suggest that workers can have equal dignity despite huge inequality in pay is just silly. In 2012, the top 40 hedge fund managers and traders were paid a combined $16.7 billion, equivalent to the wages of 400,000 ordinary workers. Given that kind of disparity, can anyone really believe in the equal dignity of work? In fact, the people who seem least inclined to respect the efforts of ordinary workers are the winners of the wealth lottery. Over the past few months, we’ve been harangued by a procession of angry billionaires, furious that they’re not receiving the deference, the acknowledgment of their superiority, that they believe is their due. For example, last week the investor Sam Zell went on CNN Money to defend the 1 percent against “envy,” and he asserted that “the 1 percent work harder. The 1 percent are much bigger factors in all forms of our society.” Dignity for all! And there’s another group that doesn’t respect workers: Republican politicians. In 2012, Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, infamously marked Labor Day with a Twitter post celebrating ... people who start their own businesses. Perhaps Mr. Cantor was chastened by the backlash to that post; at a recent G.O.P. retreat, he reportedly urged his colleagues to show some respect for Americans who don’t own businesses, who work for someone else. The clear implication was that they haven’t shown that kind of respect in the past. On the whole, working Americans are better at appreciating their own worth than either the wealthy or conservative politicians are at showing them even minimal respect. Still, tens of millions of Americans know from experience that hard work isn’t enough to provide financial security or a decent education for their children, and many either couldn’t get health insurance or were desperately afraid of losing jobs that came with insurance until the Affordable Care Act kicked in last month. In the face of that kind of everyday struggle, talk about the dignity of work rings hollow. So what would give working Americans more dignity in their lives, despite huge income disparities? How about assuring them that the essentials — health care, opportunity for their children, a minimal income — will be there even if their boss fires them or their jobs are shipped overseas? Think about it: Has anything done as much to enhance the dignity of American seniors, to rescue them from the penury and dependence that were once so common among the elderly, as Social Security and Medicare? Inside the Beltway, fiscal scolds have turned “entitlements” into a bad word, but it’s precisely the fact that Americans are entitled to collect Social Security and be covered by Medicare, no questions asked, that makes these programs so empowering and liberating. Conversely, the drive by conservatives to dismantle much of the social safety net, to replace it with minimal programs and private charity, is, in effect, an effort to strip away the dignity of lower-income workers. And it’s something else: an assault on their freedom. Modern American conservatives talk a lot about freedom, and deride liberals for advocating a “nanny state.” But when it comes to Americans down on their luck, conservatives become insultingly paternalistic, as comfortable congressmen lecture struggling families on the dignity of work. And they also become advocates of highly intrusive government. For example, House Republicans tried to introduce a provision into the farm bill that would have allowed states to mandate drug testing for food stamp recipients. (A commenter on my blog suggested mandatory drug tests for employees of too-big-to-fail financial institutions, which receive large implicit subsidies. Now that would really cause a panic.) The truth is that if you really care about the dignity and freedom of American workers, you should favor more, not fewer, entitlements, a stronger, not weaker, social safety net. And you should, in particular, support and celebrate health reform. Never mind all those claims that Obamacare is slavery; the reality is that the Affordable Care Act will empower millions of Americans, giving them exactly the kind of dignity and freedom politicians only pretend to love.",2711,2840,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/krugman-inequality-dignity-and-freedom.html,2014-02-14,"Inequality, Dignity and Freedom"
0,samira,kawash,373,article,"NOTHING is more symbolic of the romance of Valentine’s Day than a box of chocolates, traditionally a gift from Him to Her. Chocolate, with its luxurious texture and pleasurable taste, has become the edible correlate to love and desire. And although scientists haven’t discovered any definitive difference in the way men and women respond to chocolate, conventional wisdom is that women naturally crave the stuff. It’s no wonder, given the barrage of advertisements that depict wild-eyed females smacking their lips, or breaking down doors and rioting in the streets, even for slimmed-down treats like Oreo 100 Calorie Mini-Cakesters. Once the women in the ads take their first bite, a chocolate-induced euphoria invariably follows, barely disguising the association of female sexual pleasure with the candy. The comical and extreme versions of these ideas are new, but the association of chocolate with sensual pleasure is not. For decades after this “food of the gods” was brought to Europe in the 1500s by Spanish explorers, chocolate was promoted in medical and scientific treatises as a stimulant, love potion, cure for impotence, and an aid to conception. One Spanish physician, Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma, wrote in the 17th century that chocolate “vehemently Incites to Venus, and causeth Conception in women, hastens and facilitates their Delivery.” Such potency was believed to affect men as well. The English doctor Henry Stubbs, writing in the same era, extolled his countrymen’s “great use of Chocolate in Venery, and for Supplying the Testicles with a Balsam, or a Sap.” In the 19th century, an elegant box of imported bonbons was a favorite gift for men to give to their sweethearts. When candy manufacturers began advertising fancy boxes of chocolates at the turn of the 20th century, they emphasized this romantic connection by associating chocolate with female sensuality. Lowney’s Chocolate Bonbons ads of the 1890s featured flirtatious beauties holding chocolate morsels to their lips in a tantalizing depiction of the chaste moment just before consumption. A 1936 Whitman’s ad that pictured a woman lounging in pajamas on a sofa was simply captioned: “Your best Ambassador.” As few women were economically independent in that era, the chocolate pleasure depicted in these ads frequently depended on men’s generosity — with a not-so-subtle hint that some reciprocal generosity might be expected. With the onset of World War II, advertisers shifted chocolate’s implicit message from entree to sexual surrogate, capitalizing on the frequent and prolonged absence of men who were off fighting. In a Whitman’s ad from 1943, a wholesome young woman holds a piece of chocolate and stands in front of a photo of a soldier in uniform as if to say: If she can’t have the guy, she’ll have the next best thing. A cheekier ad from 1942, aimed at men, features a woman embracing a man while holding a Whitman’s Sampler. The caption reads, “Put yourself in his place” — an implication that securing a relationship was as easy as a box of chocolates. These days, not too many women are waiting around for men to give them candy. Advertisements for chocolates marketed for women’s consumption emphasize a singular and detached idea of pleasure. Foil-wrapped morsels with names like “Bliss” are promoted as indulgences that women — empowered, economically independent, desirous of pleasure but not entanglement — can acquire and enjoy by themselves. Who could forget the overt sensuality of the “My Moment, My Dove” ads that featured lithe women caressed by brown silk, writhing in pleasure? Not every ad is so forthright in its evocation of sex, but it’s hard to miss the underlying message of much chocolate advertising: Authentic female pleasure can be realized in the solitary act of eating chocolate. Recently, a faux-retro image of an apron-clad woman with a chocolate cake has turned up on posters, mugs, and earring boxes with the caption: “Because chocolate can’t get you pregnant.” The joke has two layers of irony in our diet-obsessed culture. Chocolate, as a sexual surrogate, promises today’s woman a sanitized form of pleasure without unintended consequences. Except, like pregnancy, too much chocolate “shows.”",1552,1085,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/sex-and-candy.html,2014-02-14,Sex and Candy
0,mark,bittman,877,article,"There is long-overdue support for raising the minimum wage. But among generally mistreated minimum wage workers there’s a subgroup of those whose wage experience is even more miserable and unfair. The group is tipped workers, the majority of whom are restaurant servers. There is a minimum wage for tipped workers, called by those who know the “tipped minimum wage.” An informal survey on my part would indicate that many well-educated professionals, even high-ranking city officials, don’t know about this; that’s excusable, since almost no one talks about it. In any case, few who already know about the tipped minimum wage could guess how low it can go. Try. Are you ready? $2.13. Uh-huh. And although there are those who would argue that raising this pathetic excuse for payment would increase unemployment, raise the price of restaurant food and hurt the restaurant industry (by logical extension, we should be lowering this wage, perhaps all the way to zero?), they are, of course, apologists for the tightwad industry itself, an industry represented by the National Restaurant Association — the other N.R.A., the Herman Cain gang — which has fought to preserve the $2.13 tipped minimum wage through the last two increases in the general minimum wage, and will no doubt fight it again. As a result, the tipped minimum wage has remained at the same level for more than 20 years. (This is part of a general pattern of employer-inspired attacks on labor, which is as old as capitalism.) Here’s the fine print: If a worker — not necessarily a restaurant worker, but again, most in this category are — earns $30 or more from tips per month, her employer (most tipped workers are women; we’ll get to that) may pay $2.13 per hour, assuming that their earnings equal or exceed the federal minimum wage, currently a whopping $7.25 an hour. It’s not the same in every state, as David Cooper explains in this excellent Economic Policy Institute post: “There are 18 states where the tipped minimum wage is $2.13, seven states where the tipped minimum wage is equal to the regular minimum wage.” Many states have tipped minimum wages greater than $2.13, but not by much; 22 states still allow employers to pay tipped workers less than $3 per hour. And there are many indications, both in Department of Labor surveys and anecdotally, that the fill-in-the-gap rule is largely ignored. (In one series of Department of Labor investigations, the violation rate was found to be upwards of 80 percent.) Then there are the stories of tip-skimming by management. Workers might not know they’re entitled to the difference, or they may be threatened or fired if they demand that employers make up the difference between actual earnings and minimum wage. Thus there are a number of active lawsuits brought by members of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC-United, which I wrote about a couple of years ago) against the Darden chain, which owns Red Lobster and Olive Garden and is the world’s largest employer of tipped workers (Applebee’s is second). It’s worth noting that there are many restaurant owners who voluntarily bypass the tipped minimum wage and pay front-of-house staff regular wages. And seven states have eliminated the tipped minimum wage, while others are moving toward doing so. (If you want to get wonky about this, check out this table from the Department of Labor, which breaks down minimum wages for tipped employees state-by-state.) As usual, California is the most notable exception; it abandoned the tipped minimum wage decades ago and has the largest restaurant industry in the country. San Francisco’s $10.74 minimum wage does not appear to have slowed restaurant growth there. The Fair Minimum Wage Act currently under consideration in Congress would increase the national tipped minimum wage (over a five-year period, beginning with passage) until it reaches 70 percent of the regular minimum wage. Better, but not good enough, by a long shot. Consider that the United States is the only major country where both custom and law dictate that there are occupations in which the responsibility for paying the majority of a group of workers’ incomes lies not with employers but with customers. Think about the times when you withheld or undertipped because you felt you were getting “bad” service. (I’ve done it, too, of course. Only saints haven’t.) When we do this, we deprive that server of her income. But that “tip” is actually the wage. This doesn’t make us bad people, I don’t think, though clearly our judgment could be questioned. But it does make it a bad system. And a sexist one. Seventy percent of restaurant servers are women, so effectively when you enforce a policy that says “It’s O.K. to pay tipped workers less than ‘regular’ workers,” you’re discriminating against a job largely done by women and reinforcing the age-old notion that women’s work is worth less than men’s. It’s almost as if servers have to interview with the people paying the majority of their wages — customers — every time a new person sits down; their income is dependent on our judgment and largesse (and, we hope, our sense of fairness). And when you listen to Saru Jayaraman, co-director of ROC-United and director of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, and a woman who hears workers’ stories daily, you realize even more what an unjust situation this is: “The level of sexual harassment is four times higher in restaurants than in the average of other sectors, and there are endless stories of women being sent home to dress more sexually — to show more cleavage, for example.” On Thursday, ROC-United had its annual “2/13” day of action, calling on us, and Congress, to “love your server” and raise the tipped minimum wage. Valentine’s Day is the second busiest restaurant day of the year, after Mother’s Day. Thank that server — who is not going out to dinner with her loved one, she’s waiting on you — and think about this: For 23 years the federal tipped minimum wage has stood at $2.13. Isn’t it time to change that?",2195,1228,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/bittman-a-valentine-for-restaurant-workers.html,2014-02-14,A Valentine for Restaurant Workers
0,héctor,abad,163,article,"MEDELLÍN, Colombia —  Most everyone agrees: The only thing worse than killing is being killed. If our lives are threatened, we have the right to defend ourselves, with force if necessary. In a civilized society, that defense is delegated to the state. But not all of us, apparently, live in that kind of civilized society. Colombia in the 1990s saw the rise of vigilante self-defense groups. In its impotence and desperation at not being able to rapidly win the war against the guerrilla army (which was essentially a drug cartel) and against the drug lord Pablo Escobar’s private army, the state gave the green light to these groups — called Convivir. They were made up of agricultural laborers, trained by soldiers, and financed by landowners and agribusinesses. When they began to extort money from the very businessmen who were financing them, they were declared illegal. But it was already too late. They had become clandestine paramilitary groups, using the same weapons as those they were fighting: kidnapping, murder of innocents, drug trafficking. What has been going on these last few months in Mexico, in the western state of Michoacán, makes me fear that the same thing is happening there today. “Autodefensas” have organized to drive out the vicious local drug cartel, called the Knights Templar. After first demanding that the vigilantes disband, the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto has now sanctioned them as part of the Rural Defense Corps — at least nominally under the control of the military. This is how it happens. The army, with the blessing of the central authorities, looks for an ally, a lesser evil among the local powers. Compared with the cruel and bloodthirsty Knights Templar, the self-defense groups have popular support and are allowed to operate. Meanwhile, the government ignores the fact that some of these vigilantes might be financed by the enemies of the Knights Templar — for example, rival drug gangs or another cartel from the neighboring state of Jalisco.  The government allows the vigilantes to act for a while, but when it tries to come back in, the self-defense groups will have turned into a real armed power with whom the government will have to make a pact, for without them the state won’t be able to assert its authority. Mexico, like several Latin American countries, is able to guarantee security and the rule of law only in certain zones. The lifeblood of law and order manages to flow near the heart of power, around the big cities, but the farther away we get, the weaker the pulse, and in some places there is none at all. Police officers are few and corrupt, judges live under threat from local despots and strongmen, and the legitimate authorities have been paid off by illegal ones. It’s like the American Wild West, but with 21st-century armaments, private armies funded by the torrential flow of money from drug trafficking, and no prospect of a righteous sheriff riding in to restore calm. Sometimes the United States — which understands itself so well, but badly misunderstands Latin American realities — asks governments of its friendly southern neighbors to wage heroic battles. It asks for elimination of illicit crops, total war on drugs or extermination of guerrilla forces. The most obedient governments ignore what might be real solutions — like cutting off the source of the cartels’ enormous wealth by legalizing drugs — and instead attempt to carry out these requests. They send their national armies to undertake the thankless task of fighting against their own compatriots. That’s what Felipe Calderón, Mexico’s previous president, tried. But these wars to the death always fail. What they generate is local powers defending themselves by arming to the teeth, and outlying territories turning into battlefields where life is impossible for defenseless civilians. The legitimate economy and tourism disappear, death tolls soar (to around 80,000 in Mexico), and the final winner, inevitably, is not the state but some local narco-dictator with his own army of mercenaries. This is what we learned in Colombia: When the state is not present, it is local tyrants who take power and brutally impose their rules, which are nothing more than the defense of their privileges. The old Hobbesian concept, that the natural state of mankind is that man is a wolf to man, seems confirmed in these involuntary Latin American anarchist experiments. The strongest and richest wolf (from trafficking drugs or illegal mining) dominates the other wolves. Of course, every country is different. But I fear that today Mexico is making the same mistake Colombia did a quarter of a century ago. The vigilantes appear to be a cure — they are seen as saviors — but in reality they are part of the illness, one more illegal army, acting without restraints and financed by dirty money. In Colombia, the self-defense groups were eventually pursued until, in 2003, 25,000 of them were forced to demobilize. Since they were also drug traffickers, a few top paramilitary ringleaders ended up being extradited to the United States. But their legacy persists. Their descendants still live in Colombia and still have power: Now they’re called criminal gangs, and they are still practicing extortion and murder financed by illegal mining and drug money. The vigilantes might begin by killing kidnappers, drug dealers and extortionists, but soon they begin killing their relatives, and then their friends, or those they think are their friends, and then the friends’ families, until everyone is suspect and they might come knocking at your own door, as happened to us in Colombia — as happened to my own father, when he was gunned down in the streets of Medellín. To allow private armies, even if they are supposedly for self-defense, is to create a monster like the Hydra: If you cut off one head, two more grow back.

0,timothy,egan,1274,article,"It’s been nearly two weeks now since Bill O’Reilly’s interview with President Obama on Super Bowl Sunday, and in the No Spin Zone of the host’s pretend world he’s still spinning the chat as the greatest conversation since Winston Churchill dined alone. His sit-down with the president, he said, “is going to go down in journalistic history as what should be done.” And in case historians are late to the same conclusion, O’Reilly is auctioning off the notes of his questions — “they are obviously one of a kind,” he says. Let us now praise the Bombastic One’s gift to posterity. His interview, his notes, all the ephemera should be preserved and studied. The sickness that infects news and politics, and its commensurate cynicism, can be directly traced to the creation of Fox News — “a political operation that employs journalists,” in the words of Gabriel Sherman, author of the new book on Roger Ailes, “The Loudest Voice in the Room.” There is no bigger media story in the last 50 years than the creation of a news network run by political hacks, says Sherman. I’m inclined to agree. But just as important, civility itself took a dive with the rise of Fox, and has never recovered. The shouters, the boasters, the haters who show up at town hall meetings or pollute the Web with dark fantasies get their behavioral cues from Fox. O’Reilly is famous for telling guests to “shut up,” for cutting off people he disagrees with, for smugly praising his own performances and bringing on sycophants to do the same. By comparison, Ron Burgundy is a model of humility. A congress where members can shout “You lie” at a president, or tweet “socialist dictator” and “Kommandant-in-chef” (sic), is another result of the vulgar forces unleashed by Fox. Imagine Walter Cronkite, Diane Sawyer, Terry Gross or Tim Russert devoting entire shows to praising their own work. A good interview makes news, or reveals something fresh about the subject. So, the first point for historians sniffing the odor of O’Reilly’s time capsule in 2114 is that the interview made no news. No ground was broken. It was a journalistic dud. O’Reilly himself spoke for about 40 percent of the time, and devoted 90 percent of the interview to “the full Fox scandal grab bag,” as Jon Stewart called it. O’Reilly, in four days of talking about himself after the interview, said his role is to hold politicians accountable. If only. Remember how accountable he held George W. Bush when the president took the country to war on a lie, bankrupting the nation in the process? You don’t? Here’s a sample, from a 2004 interview with Bush, then in a heated election contest with John Kerry. That September, a series of incendiary ads, questioning the military service of Kerry in Vietnam, was a hot topic. O’Reilly: “You didn’t know anything about the Swift Boat ads before they went on the air, did you?” Bush: “No, I didn’t.” O’Reilly: “Did Karl Rove know anything about it?” Bush: “I don’t think so.” In fact, records show that the bulk of the funding for those smears came from two men with close ties to Bush — one a longtime associate of Karl Rove’s, something that was easily found by a document search. O’Reilly then dismissed as “propaganda” questions about whether the combination of massive tax cuts and two costly wars might leave the country broke. But he did drill Bush on why there are so many liberal college professors and “pinheads” at Harvard and Yale. The biggest issue at the time was how the United States could be fooled into going to war over nonexistence weapons of mass destruction. O’Reilly: “What happened to Saddam’s chemical arsenal? Do you know?” Bush: “No, I don’t.” O’Reilly: “He hasn’t given us much, has he?” Other news organizations, The New York Times among them, were less watchdog than lapdog at times as well. But from beginning of this debacle to the mission-accomplished end, Fox worked closely with the White House. Ailes offered strategic advice in the run-up to the war, and Fox was the lead cheerleader. The same Fox host who says his job is to hold politicians accountable actually warned his fellow citizens not to raise questions or protest. “Americans, and indeed our allies who actively work against our military once the war is underway, will be considered enemies of the state by me,” said O’Reilly. “Just fair warning to you, Barbra Streisand, and others who see the world as you do.” Since Benghazi dominated O’Reilly’s interview with Obama, it’s fair to check how many times O’Reilly asked Bush about at least six attacks on United States embassies and consulates during his first term. Zero. It never came up in three long interviews, according to the transcripts Fox posted. Little wonder that Bush felt right at home with O’Reilly. “I really enjoy how you interview people and I appreciate you giving me a chance to come on and have, what we say in Texas, ‘just a visit.'” Just a visit for one president, a trip to the scandal trough for another. Should O’Reilly ever sit for an interview on his own past, on terms he applies to Fox’s enemies, it would include questions about the lawsuit from a former subordinate who complained of “constant and relentless sexual harassment.” No spin there. No questions either. After a reported $10 million settlement was paid to keep the details inside Fox, O’Reilly said, “This brutal ordeal is now officially over, and I will never speak of it again.” We could ask O’Reilly about the softball interview he did with former Governor Mike Huckabee concerning the felon he let out of prison early in Arkansas who went on to murder four police officers. This kind of politician should be a punching bag for O’Reilly, Willie Horton-ized to a pulp. Unless, of course, he worked for Fox. O’Reilly praised his colleague as “a stand-up guy.” From the War on Christmas to the Frankenstein monster of the Tea Party, Fox’s creations have been uniformly bad for American life. Regular viewers of Fox are less-well-informed than people who are exposed to no media. So yes, future generations should study O’Reilly’s interview. Learn from it, as with all mistakes of history, lest it be repeated.",1510,1503,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/bill-oreillys-gift-for-the-ages.html,2014-02-14,Bill O’Reilly’s Gift for the Ages
0,,,47,article,"Last month, the Yale Environmental Performance Index ranked India 174th out of 178 countries on air pollution. According to India’s Central Pollution Control Board, in 2010, particulate matter in the air of 180 Indian cities was six times higher than World Health Organization standards. More people die of asthma in India than anywhere else in the world. Indoor air pollution, mostly from cooking fires, and outdoor air pollution are the third and fifth leading causes of death in India. Automobile sales in India have boomed, and diesel is the fuel of choice. Many industries pollute with impunity, defying existing environmental laws and regulations. Pollution monitoring in India is a haphazard affair. Industries know that even if they are caught polluting, criminal prosecution will take years to go through India’s overburdened courts. The best hope for reining in air pollution lies with India’s Supreme Court. It has handed down a series of landmark environmental decisions, including mandating the use of compressed natural gas in public-service vehicles in Delhi in 1985. Air quality in India’s capital improved, but the gains have since evaporated. On Monday, the court asked the governments of Delhi and the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan to respond to a report from India’s Environmental Pollution Control Authority that said air pollution has reached such severe levels that it is the cause of 3,000 child deaths a year in Delhi alone. The report recommends a series of measures, including a 30 percent tax on the sale of diesel vehicles, higher automobile registration and parking fees, and getting more buses on Delhi’s roads. The Supreme Court should use its authority to order compliance with these recommendations. And India’s national air-quality standards must be made legally binding. The World Bank says that environmental degradation is costing India $80 billion annually and accounts for 23 percent of the nation’s child mortality. The bank estimated that reducing particulate emissions by 30 percent by 2030 would save India $105 billion in health-related costs. So far, pollution has not been an issue ahead of general elections in May.

0,naftali,bennett,178,article,"JERUSALEM —  As soldiers in Israel’s army, one of the most grueling training regimens we had to endure was a long march while carrying a comrade on a stretcher. I’m reminded of those hikes today as the government works to ease the burden of the “national stretcher” on Israeli society, in which fewer and fewer citizens are carrying an ever-heavier load. With extremely low labor participation, ultra-Orthodox Jews and Israeli-Arab women have unfortunately slipped into a situation of welfare and poverty. For ultra-Orthodox men, it stems from a refusal to serve in the military and instead to sign up for religious study in yeshivas. For Arab women, it has been the lack of education and a culture in which they are expected to stay at home. Already, just over a quarter of first graders in Israel are ultra-Orthodox. Israel will not be able to sustain itself if these children are not integrated into society and the labor market. Meanwhile, the secular and national religious camps — the backbone of the middle class — serve in the Israel Defense Forces, work and pay exorbitant taxes, reaching up to 50 percent of their income. This situation must end. My goal is to get ultra-Orthodox men and Arab women into the work force, to free them from the clutches of poverty, and to get the ultra-Orthodox to enlist in the I.D.F. It’s true that Israel has a growing economy and impressive high-tech innovation. But it is time to recognize the mistakes that have led to the creation of two different economies and to take decisive action. The Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, is currently debating whether to take a historic step by passing legislation that would pave the way for ultra-Orthodox men to join the work force and serve in the Israel Defense Forces. I am aware of the political obstacles. Ultra-Orthodox politicians and rabbis are opposed to the implementation of this plan and are using all of their political influence to prevent us from succeeding. I have also paid a personal price. Historically, the National Religious Party, which my party — Jewish Home — is built upon, has aligned itself in consecutive Israeli governments with the ultra-Orthodox factions. By joining a government without ultra-Orthodox representation, we have become the target for their ongoing attacks, with some of my fellow party members having been heckled and harassed at public events. Under the bill, all ultra-Orthodox men would eventually be put on the same path as secular and national religious men — one of military service and employment. Over the next four years, they would be granted a grace period to pursue their personal ambitions. They would be allowed to continue studying in a yeshiva if they wished or to enlist in the military and join the work force. I expect they will choose the latter since they have the best incentive: avoiding poverty. This could do wonders for the economy. After receiving vocational training and education, this new source of talent would flow into Israel’s work force in a way that has not been seen since the huge post-Soviet immigration of the 1990s, when some one million people immigrated to Israel. Like the integration of the ultra-Orthodox, bringing Israeli-Arab women into the labor market is also a major priority. The employment rate for Arab women in Israel is currently extremely low: just over 25 percent. My goal is to double it within the next five years. We are establishing 21 one-stop employment shops where Arab women from over 60 towns will be able to receive vocational training, small business loans and general business guidance. We are subsidizing day care so young mothers can go to work and we are, in some cases, even helping companies that hire Arab women by subsidizing up to 37 percent of the women’s salaries for over two years. This will allow employers, who until now were reluctant to hire Arab women, to provide these women with the opportunity to work and support their families. The Israeli government has already established a fund to encourage young Arab women, specifically from the Bedouin community, to study engineering. We are funding their university studies and providing them with mentors who assist them with their studies and the job placement process. Transforming the labor market will not be easy. There is prejudice against both the ultra-Orthodox and the Arab community. Many of the Arab women live far away from main cities where the jobs are; and, in many cases, husbands prefer that their wives stay at home. But the Israeli economy belongs to both its Jewish and Arab citizens and the status quo simply cannot continue. Beyond easing the burden and spreading prosperity, these new initiatives will have a greater and more profound impact on Israel’s national identity. In my previous career as a chief executive of high-tech companies, I experienced firsthand the endless possibilities when people from diverse backgrounds work together. They get to know one another and quickly learn that they share more in common than they originally thought. Just imagine the new Israeli workplace: Arab men and women sitting together with secular, ultra-Orthodox and national-religious Jewish men and women all focused on the same objective — advancing our economy and our country. Differences, which until then seemed insurmountable, would gradually disappear. In the army, the one thing that kept us going during those long “stretcher hikes” was the knowledge that, while they might be hard, we would eventually reach our destination. The Israeli economy is embarking on an uphill journey. And if all sectors of society pull together, we will succeed.

0,héctor,abad,163,article,"MEDELLÍN, Colombia —  Most everyone agrees: The only thing worse than killing is being killed. If our lives are threatened, we have the right to defend ourselves, with force if necessary. In a civilized society, that defense is delegated to the state. But not all of us, apparently, live in that kind of civilized society. Colombia in the 1990s saw the rise of vigilante self-defense groups. In its impotence and desperation at not being able to rapidly win the war against the guerrilla army (which was essentially a drug cartel) and against the drug lord Pablo Escobar’s private army, the state gave the green light to these groups — called Convivir. They were made up of agricultural laborers, trained by soldiers, and financed by landowners and agribusinesses. When they began to extort money from the very businessmen who were financing them, they were declared illegal. But it was already too late. They had become clandestine paramilitary groups, using the same weapons as those they were fighting: kidnapping, murder of innocents, drug trafficking. What has been going on these last few months in Mexico, in the western state of Michoacán, makes me fear that the same thing is happening there today. “Autodefensas” have organized to drive out the vicious local drug cartel, called the Knights Templar. After first demanding that the vigilantes disband, the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto has now sanctioned them as part of the Rural Defense Corps — at least nominally under the control of the military. This is how it happens. The army, with the blessing of the central authorities, looks for an ally, a lesser evil among the local powers. Compared with the cruel and bloodthirsty Knights Templar, the self-defense groups have popular support and are allowed to operate. Meanwhile, the government ignores the fact that some of these vigilantes might be financed by the enemies of the Knights Templar — for example, rival drug gangs or another cartel from the neighboring state of Jalisco.  The government allows the vigilantes to act for a while, but when it tries to come back in, the self-defense groups will have turned into a real armed power with whom the government will have to make a pact, for without them the state won’t be able to assert its authority. Mexico, like several Latin American countries, is able to guarantee security and the rule of law only in certain zones. The lifeblood of law and order manages to flow near the heart of power, around the big cities, but the farther away we get, the weaker the pulse, and in some places there is none at all. Police officers are few and corrupt, judges live under threat from local despots and strongmen, and the legitimate authorities have been paid off by illegal ones. It’s like the American Wild West, but with 21st-century armaments, private armies funded by the torrential flow of money from drug trafficking, and no prospect of a righteous sheriff riding in to restore calm. Sometimes the United States — which understands itself so well, but badly misunderstands Latin American realities — asks governments of its friendly southern neighbors to wage heroic battles. It asks for elimination of illicit crops, total war on drugs or extermination of guerrilla forces. The most obedient governments ignore what might be real solutions — like cutting off the source of the cartels’ enormous wealth by legalizing drugs — and instead attempt to carry out these requests. They send their national armies to undertake the thankless task of fighting against their own compatriots. That’s what Felipe Calderón, Mexico’s previous president, tried. But these wars to the death always fail. What they generate is local powers defending themselves by arming to the teeth, and outlying territories turning into battlefields where life is impossible for defenseless civilians. The legitimate economy and tourism disappear, death tolls soar (to around 80,000 in Mexico), and the final winner, inevitably, is not the state but some local narco-dictator with his own army of mercenaries. This is what we learned in Colombia: When the state is not present, it is local tyrants who take power and brutally impose their rules, which are nothing more than the defense of their privileges. The old Hobbesian concept, that the natural state of mankind is that man is a wolf to man, seems confirmed in these involuntary Latin American anarchist experiments. The strongest and richest wolf (from trafficking drugs or illegal mining) dominates the other wolves. Of course, every country is different. But I fear that today Mexico is making the same mistake Colombia did a quarter of a century ago. The vigilantes appear to be a cure — they are seen as saviors — but in reality they are part of the illness, one more illegal army, acting without restraints and financed by dirty money. In Colombia, the self-defense groups were eventually pursued until, in 2003, 25,000 of them were forced to demobilize. Since they were also drug traffickers, a few top paramilitary ringleaders ended up being extradited to the United States. But their legacy persists. Their descendants still live in Colombia and still have power: Now they’re called criminal gangs, and they are still practicing extortion and murder financed by illegal mining and drug money. The vigilantes might begin by killing kidnappers, drug dealers and extortionists, but soon they begin killing their relatives, and then their friends, or those they think are their friends, and then the friends’ families, until everyone is suspect and they might come knocking at your own door, as happened to us in Colombia — as happened to my own father, when he was gunned down in the streets of Medellín. To allow private armies, even if they are supposedly for self-defense, is to create a monster like the Hydra: If you cut off one head, two more grow back.

0,bina,shah,34,article,"KARACHI, Pakistan —  Given its dependence on foreign aid and its high level of foreign and domestic debt, Pakistan has always been seen abroad as a country with a begging bowl around its neck. In 2008, for example, $3.6 billion in foreign economic assistance flowed in, but about half of it was needed to service debt. Meanwhile, according to Shamsh Kassim-Lakha, chairman of the Pakistan Center for Philanthropy, charitable donations by citizens equal what the government spends on social welfare, which last year was estimated at a bit short of $2 billion, or about 1 percent of gross domestic product. One reason: Only 2 percent of the population actually pay taxes in a land where per capita income averages $2,900, and where the United Nations says nearly half the people live at or below the poverty line. Is this how a modern country functions? In Pakistan, poverty is not sanitized; it’s on full display. What helps save the society is a culture of giving, interwoven into the fabric of how people live and worship. The World Giving Index for 2013, compiled by the Charities Aid Foundation from Gallup polling data, reported that 38 percent of all Pakistanis donated money to charity in 2012, and that 51 percent found some way to help a stranger. For those Pakistanis with money to donate, it’s nearly impossible to decide which cause is most deserving; after all, the great mass of the population could be labeled “less fortunate.” It’s also hard to know whom to trust. The focal point of philanthropy each year is the holy month of Ramadan, when Islam’s obligation to give to the poor intensifies. Those who miss the daily fast, for example, must feed a poor person. All month, organizations like hospitals, schools, associations for the disabled, education foundations and Islamic charities vie for contributions on billboards, fliers and newspaper ads. And on an announced day, the government collects 2.5 percent from most savings accounts to distribute to approved private charities. This is meant to enforce the Islamic obligation of charity, known as Zakat; in the 2008-9 fiscal year, it yielded about $167 million. But while Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam, many Pakistanis prefer to give it privately, to charities of their own choice. They either seek an exemption or draw down their accounts before the withdrawal date — a tactical move that speaks less to their religious inclinations (or to whether a promise to give will be kept) and more to their scorn for the corruption that plagues Pakistan; there have been too many reports of mysterious disappearances from the government’s Zakat withdrawals. Mistrust of the government is also the root of tax noncompliance. Even as critics point out that the government has little trouble finding money for the military, officials blame meager tax collections for their low spending on social welfare. The gaps are left to an incredibly strong and active network of Islamic social welfare agencies to fill — educating two million young Pakistanis in their free schools, for example, and providing relief after floods and earthquakes. The Islamic charities consider service to others in the name of God the highest form of worship. But some have been accused of fostering terrorism under the guise of philanthropy, and the government has been accused of a failure to track the charities’ activities and sources of money. A number of madrasas and mosques with foreign funding that propagate extreme right-wing religious ideology have come under the most criticism. Still, most charity in Pakistan is free of controversy. In fact, the religious mandate to help the poor is just the starting point for a culture of philanthropy that Prof. Christopher Candland, co-director of South Asian studies at Wellesley College, has called “everyday humanitarianism.” Pakistan also has a strong network of philanthropy that includes the Aga Khan Foundation, corporate-sponsored projects and the Edhi Foundation. The latter group runs a vast system of orphanages, air and road ambulances, women’s shelters and drug rehabilitation centers. Mr. Kassim-Lakha attributes the commitment to giving to a regional culture that includes Islam, but also predates it. “Both the Hindu culture and the Buddhist culture, which were here before Islam ever came here, are cultures of giving,” he said. Still, Pakistan’s private sector has work to do to turn this generosity into large-scale social development. The Pakistan Center for Philanthropy is encouraging investment in schools, hospitals and shelters, while seeking legislation to encourage more efficient use of donations. Under a certification system that it developed, those who donate 20 percent of their income to certified organizations, or corporations that donate 10 percent of before-tax profits, receive tax exemptions and other benefits. Pakistanis give because their culture has imparted a deep need to help the less fortunate. But even as their dependency on foreign charity is often blamed for stunting economic development, a parallel problem may go largely unrecognized — that Pakistan’s internal benevolence may encourage the poor to rely on handouts rather than seek economic independence. Mr. Kassim-Lakha captures the spirit of the culture, and the dilemma, when he asks: “We have the capacity to be self-sufficient. After all, how long can we continue to rely on external benevolence?”

0,roger,cohen,75,article,"BERLIN —  This is as bad a moment as there has been in German-American relations in the postwar years. The poison of the United States surveillance scandal, absent an apology from Washington, continues to seep through a society where the right to personal privacy is a paramount value shaped by history. With the end of the Cold War division of Europe now a quarter-century distant, and the old strategic imperatives of trans-Atlantic cohesion long gone, much is made of the shared values of Europe and the United States as the glue that binds them. But in the case of Germany this argument no longer holds. If anything, a cultural gulf has emerged. The clash of three traumas — the Nazis and then the Stasi in Germany, and 9/11 in the United States — has left each society with a different appreciation of the relative value of privacy and personal freedom on the one hand and security on the other. Or at least that is the way they perceive each other. Few things summon the nightmarish past in Germany quite like revelations that their personal data and chat is being vacuumed up. Get over it, say Americans, a chief 9/11 plotter lived in Hamburg. Being a world power and a regional power are not the same. A leaked conversation in which Victoria Nuland, the top American diplomat for Europe, used the f-word to sum up her sentiments about the European Union and its efforts at diplomacy in Ukraine infuriated Chancellor Angela Merkel, who through her spokesman called the remarks “absolutely unacceptable.” Merkel still feels angry, betrayed and humiliated by the National Security Agency’s eavesdropping on her cellphone. She recently told one politician close to her that she misses George W. Bush. The relationship between Europe’s most powerful leader and President Obama is strained. It got off to a bad start and never recovered. Obama was not pleased that Merkel refused his request to speak at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate when he was candidate in 2008; Merkel thought the idea hubristic, Obama was not yet president after all. She hates soaring rhetoric and feels Obama over-promises and under-delivers (Guantánamo, climate change, nuclear Global Zero). Obama has qualms of his own: the German opt-out on Libya and austerity-driven recipes for the European Union. This, in any event, is the first postwar American president for whom trans-Atlantic sentiments are more duty-bound than heartfelt. The so-called United States pivot to Asia reflected shifting power but also personal inclination. Now, perhaps all this is not so bad. For decades, Germany was America’s problem. The postwar republic emerged under American tutelage. As that parental relationship ended, there were bound to be difficulties. This is the best Germany there has ever been, prosperous and at peace with its neighbors. One senior official told me: “It’s O.K. not to be the problem any longer. But how can we be problem-solvers together?” The question is hanging there as an ever-stronger Germany reconsiders its foreign policy and appraises the lingering surveillance-scandal damage. The first weeks of Merkel’s new government have seen a marked rhetorical shift away from restraint. Joachim Gauck, the German president, has lambasted those “who use Germany’s guilt for its past as a shield for laziness or a desire to disengage from the world.” He has said the time for distrust is past; it is now a time for greater German responsibility. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister, who is in Moscow this week, has also inveighed against a culture of sitting on the sidelines. A sweeping review of foreign policy involving town hall debates and online forums is underway. As always in Germany the balance between assertiveness and meekness is delicate. But the pendulum has swung toward a Germany that holds back less. How these words translate into action remains to be seen. The dispatch of a few German soldiers to Africa, help in the disposal of Syrian chemical weapons, a reinvigorated German-French relationship, and Steinmeier’s Putin diplomacy on Ukraine are initial signs. There will be more. It is unquestionably in America’s interest to work closely with Germany as this needed adjustment unfolds. For that, a way past the current estrangement has to be found. Steinmeier has warned that the loss of trust, particularly among young Germans, “will not heal by itself.” He has proposed a trans-Atlantic forum to address the question of how fundamental civil rights are maintained in the era of big data. He has said the young generation of Germans needs to be won over anew to the trans-Atlantic bond. Steinmeier is right about all this. But despite talk from Secretary of State John Kerry of a trans-Atlantic “renaissance,” the response from Washington has been frustrating to Germany. One Obama interview with German TV did not cut it. The wound has been underestimated. A bon mot in Germany has it that Americans no longer listen, they merely listen in.",91,105,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/opinion/cohen-an-ally-offended.html,2014-02-14,An Ally Offended
0,jacob,victor,194,article,"NEW HAVEN — THERAPY programs that purport to “convert” lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender kids have caused immeasurable harm since they became prominent in the 1970s. Rigorous studies have shown again and again that efforts to change young people’s sexual orientation not only fail, but are also linked to suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, drug use and risky sexual behavior. So it’s tempting to support the model of California and New Jersey, the first states to ban conversion therapy. Under their bans, a licensed therapist who tries to subject minors to such “treatment” can lose his license and face other penalties. Similar bills have been introduced in Massachusetts, New York and Ohio. Legislative condemnation is a powerful public statement. But if the goal is shutting down as many practitioners as possible, this strategy has its limitations. For one thing, it’s unlikely that conservative states, where conversion therapists are most active, will follow suit. More important, such bans are likely to lead to costly and time-consuming legal battles. Last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had upheld the ban, stayed its decision, pending an appeal to the Supreme Court. The bans tread on a volatile question: the degree to which the First Amendment protects speech uttered by professionals, like doctors and lawyers, in the course of their work. While the Ninth Circuit found that the California ban regulated “professional conduct” that is not protected by the First Amendment, dissenting judges pointed to a 2010 Supreme Court case, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, that implied that the First Amendment’s protections could not be ignored simply by relabeling activities that involve speech as “conduct.” If the Supreme Court declines to hear the California case (in which case the ban will automatically take effect), this terrain will remain unsettled. There is a more promising way to put pressure on, or even shut down, conversion programs: existing state laws that forbid businesses and professionals to engage in deceptive practices. Despite the nearly universal consensus — including the professional associations that represent America’s pediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, school counselors, social workers and marriage and family therapists — that “conversion” or “reparative” therapy is ineffective, harmful or both, its practitioners, many of them affiliated with religious groups, continue to advertise messages like “change is possible.” Under commercial law, this is the very definition of a deceptive trade practice. Victims could sue practitioners for damages in state courts. With support from the Southern Poverty Law Center, several former patients did just that in 2012, seeking damages under New Jersey’s Consumer Fraud Act from an “ex-gay” group called Jonah (Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing). The plaintiffs cited Jonah’s false promise that it could “cure” their homosexuality — for which it charged $100 per individual therapy session. Last July, a state judge refused Jonah’s request to throw out the case, which could soon go to trial. Litigation isn’t the only recourse for victims. State regulators are responsible for ensuring that therapists and other mental health professionals abide by standards of professional conduct. States like New York, Minnesota and California have laws that forbid state-licensed professionals from using deceptive practices; in New York, for example, such professionals may not use “advertising or soliciting that is false, fraudulent, deceptive or misleading” or make claims that cannot be “substantiated by the licensee.” Violations can result in fines and the loss or suspension of one’s license. While conversion therapists would have to be targeted one at a time, the cumulative effect could be powerful. Many of the remaining practitioners are affiliated with “ex-gay” organizations that provide training and educational materials. A handful of successful suits and regulatory crackdowns could destabilize this network by bankrupting these organizations, raising malpractice insurance rates for individual conversion therapists, and leaving practitioners to reconsider the value of persisting in practices that are deceptive under the law. While the precise number of conversion therapy programs isn’t known, they exist in at least 20 states. Parents confused or distressed about their children’s sexual orientation will continue to fall prey to counselors who either promise what they cannot deliver (turning kids straight) or, without scruples, try to profit from these families’ anxieties. Their practices are despicable, but litigation and regulatory action have more potential than new legislation, in the long run, to put these snake-oil salesmen out of business.",840,316,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/ending-gay-conversion-for-good.html,2014-02-13,Ending ‘Gay Conversion’ for Good
0,orrin,devinsky,1017,article,"MANY people have heard the story of Charlotte Figi, a young girl from Colorado with severe epilepsy. After her parents began giving her a marijuana strain rich in cannabidiol (CBD), the major nonpsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, Charlotte reportedly went from having hundreds of seizures per week to only two or three per month. Previously, her illness, Dravet Syndrome, was a daily torture despite multiple high doses of powerful anti-seizure drugs. As news of Charlotte’s story moved from the Internet to a CNN story by Dr. Sanjay Gupta to Facebook pages, some families of children with similar disorders moved to Colorado, which recently legalized marijuana, to reap what they believe are the benefits of the drug. Dozens of other anecdotes of miraculous responses to marijuana treatments in children with severe epilepsy are rife on Facebook and other social media, and these reports have aroused outsize hopes and urgent demands. Based on such reports, patients and parents are finding official and backdoor ways to give marijuana to their children. But scientific studies have yet to bear out the hopes of these desperate families. The truth is we lack evidence not only for the efficacy of marijuana, but also for its safety. This concern is especially relevant in children, for whom there is good evidence that marijuana use can increase the risk of serious psychiatric disorders and long-term cognitive problems. The recent wave of state legislatures considering and often approving medical marijuana raises significant concerns. By allowing marijuana therapy for patients with diseases such as difficult-to-control epilepsy, are state legislatures endorsing the medical benefits and safety of a broad range of marijuana species and strains before they have been carefully tested and vetted? Marijuana contains around 80 cannabinoids (THC is the major psychoactive cannabinoid, largely responsible for the high) and more than 400 other compounds. The chemical composition of two genetically identical plants can vary based on growing conditions, soil content, parasites and many other factors. While the language of the legislation may be cautious, there is an implied endorsement of medical benefit for marijuana when a legislature passes a bill and a governor signs it into law, and the tremendous gaps in our knowledge are not effectively conveyed to the public. Where is the data showing that marijuana is effective for epilepsy? Although parents may report improvements in their children, it is important to remember that the placebo response is powerful, and the placebo response is greater in pediatric than adult studies. Before more children are exposed to potential risks, before more desperate families uproot themselves and spend their life savings on unproven miracle marijuana cures, we need objective data from randomized placebo-controlled trials. Based on studies showing that CBD can prevent seizures in animals and safety data from patients treated with a drug containing CBD and THC in Europe for multiple sclerosis spasms, we and other academic epilepsy centers are planning a controlled trial with pure CBD. As an initial step, we have approval from the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement to treat children with CBD derived from marijuana plants in order to understand its safety and tolerability and potential drug interactions. This information will help us plan the placebo-controlled trials that we hope will begin in 2014 and will be completed within two years. There is no reason such studies cannot be done with other products derived from marijuana, such as the oil with high CBD and low THC sold in Colorado that was used by Charlotte Figi. Paradoxically, however, as state governments increasingly make “medical” marijuana available to parents to give to their children, the federal government continues to label the nonpsychoactive CBD — as well as THC — as Schedule 1 drugs. Such drugs are said to have “no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse.” This designation hamstrings doctors from performing controlled studies. While it is possible to study Schedule 1 drugs in a controlled laboratory setting, it is extremely difficult to study these substances in patients. For our study, we keep the CBD in a 1,200-pound safe in a locked room, in a building with an alarm system. To foster research, we need to change compounds derived from marijuana from Schedule 1 to a less restrictive category. It is troubling that while few barriers exist for parents to give their children marijuana in Colorado, there are significant federal roadblocks preventing doctors from studying it in a rigorous scientific manner. When patients have not been able to get successful medical treatment, and they live in a state where the law allows medical marijuana for children — we are not suggesting they smoke the drug — compassionate use is reasonable. But for the long-term health of Charlotte and other patients like her, we urgently need valid data.",2001,1288,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/we-need-proof-on-marijuana.html,2014-02-13,We Need Proof on Marijuana
0,,,27,article,"Creating a citywide identification card for people who can’t get driver’s licenses — unauthorized immigrants, mostly — sounds like a modest, well-meaning, good-government initiative that is part practical, part symbolic. Cities like New Haven and San Francisco have already done it. Bringing such an innovation to New York City, as Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed on Monday, would be a big deal. It would be a boost for a growing national immigrant-rights movement, sending a message that even in a country that has failed to fix its immigration system, cities can be more welcoming and more humane. It would be a powerful rebuke to the forces that have stalemated reform in Congress, rejecting all practical solutions out of the irrational conviction that unwanted immigrants must never be assimilated, only expelled. Most important, it would make life easier, and safer, for hundreds of thousands of people. The mayor’s office says it will introduce legislation to the City Council in coming weeks. It has not provided specifics, but the proposal’s general outlines are solid: a city-issued ID card, bearing a photo, signature, address and biographical data, would be available to all New York residents, regardless of immigration status. Applicants could use foreign passports or other government-issued papers to prove identity, and things like utility bills to prove New York residency. Those holding cards would be able to file police reports, which many unauthorized immigrants are now unable to do. Being undocumented often forces immigrants to be mute victims and bystanders to crime; allowing them to assert their identities would remove one reason to shun the police. The cards would allow residents to enter government buildings and have easier access to public services. They could get library cards and sign leases. They should — this will have to be negotiated with financial institutions — be able to open bank accounts. The city is also planning to allow cardholders to receive discounts on things like tennis and parking permits and recreation-center memberships. Mr. de Blasio’s aides say that, for now, they are not considering having the ID cards function as debit or credit cards, as some cities have tried to do. Such a feature would be useful because unauthorized immigrants who can’t deposit their cash earnings in a bank are magnets for criminals. But this may be a complicated and expensive feature, as cardholders in some cities have ended up paying stiff fees for banking services. This is a legitimate worry, but New York should not rule out finding some way to link its IDs — safely and affordably — to electronic banking. One important task for designers should be to make the ID cards useful enough that native-born New Yorkers want them, too. If only unauthorized immigrants use the cards, advocates fear that they could become a “scarlet letter” that readily identifies their holders’ lack of status. The broader hope, of course, is to bring immigrants from the margins closer to the mainstream. Mr. de Blasio has placed a strong and admirable emphasis on making sure this city does not forget the poor, the older, homeless, undocumented and others who need help establishing and maintaining a foothold in the community. Americans who are well-documented can take this status for granted. With their driver’s licenses and credit cards, they can always say: This is who I am. Imagine the difficulty of negotiating life in a big city without being able to convince anyone of who you are.",89,90,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/mr-de-blasios-welcoming-gesture.html,2014-02-13,Mr. de Blasio’s Welcoming Gesture
0,,,53,article,"Much of the debate over Scottish independence has focused on whether the Scots would be better off in or out of the United Kingdom. With the Sept. 18 Scottish referendum now only seven months off, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has raised another critical question: Would Britain be better off without Scotland? His resounding and even emotional answer in a speech last week, formally opening his government’s pro-union campaign, was that after 300 years, Britain would be “deeply diminished” without Scotland. Whatever Scots may think of Mr. Cameron, and polls suggest it’s not much, the question he raises is not one they should dismiss. In effect, Mr. Cameron has declared — somewhat as Canada did in the 1990s, when Quebec was voting on independence — that whether Scotland stays or leaves affects all Britain — England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as Scotland. Minus the Scots, Mr. Cameron argued, the “powerful” United Kingdom brand would be diminished, a notion he theatrically underscored by making his speech in the Olympic Park in East London on the opening day of the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and recalling the essential role of Scottish athletes on what was billed as “Team G.B.,” for Great Britain. (Mr. Cameron should recall some of his phrases — like “we matter more in the world together” — when it comes time to prepare for the referendum he has pledged on whether Britain should remain in the European Union.) Certainly the debate over the economic advantages and disadvantages of separation should be an important factor in how the Scots vote. But independence goes far beyond that, and another people who broke away from Britain cautioned in their Declaration of Independence that “governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes.” Any serious debate on secession — whether in Scotland, Catalonia or Quebec — should focus not only on economic calculations, but, as Mr. Cameron urged, on whether breaking one great state into two lesser states is better for either. Scotland, moreover, has achieved considerable autonomy within Britain, including its own elected assembly in addition to seats in the British Parliament. Of course, the economic issues will be a major factor for the four million or so Scottish voters who will decide their fate. Alex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland who is leading the independence drive, invokes a Scotland that has its own place in the European Union yet retains the British pound as its currency. But the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has ruled out a currency union, and membership in the European Union would require lengthy negotiations. And then there is the fact that smaller members, including Ireland, have not fared well in recent years. So, as the countdown begins for the fateful vote, the Scots should certainly weigh the potential economic consequences, but also the pros and cons of dropping out of “Team G.B.”",150,93,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/why-team-gb-needs-scotland.html,2014-02-13,Why ‘Team G.B.’ Needs Scotland
0,charles,blow,476,article,"Associate Justice Clarence Thomas doesn’t often speak during oral arguments before the Supreme Court. But often what he says outside the chamber is eyebrow-raising. Such was the case Tuesday when Thomas told an audience at Palm Beach Atlantic University: “My sadness is that we are probably today more race- and difference-conscious than I was in the 1960s when I went to school. To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Ga., to go to a white school. Rarely did the issue of race come up.” He continued: “Now, name a day it doesn’t come up. Differences in race, differences in sex, somebody doesn’t look at you right, somebody says something. Everybody is sensitive. If I had been as sensitive as that in the 1960s, I’d still be in Savannah. Every person in this room has endured a slight. Every person. Somebody has said something that has hurt their feelings or did something to them — left them out.” He added: “The worst I have been treated was by northern liberal elites. The absolute worst I have ever been treated.” There is so much to unpack here that one hardly knows where to start. But let’s start here: The racial reality of blacks in the South in the 1960s was that race- and difference-consciousness was virtually inescapable, and often stifling. It’s unclear to me whether Thomas is being amnesiac in his recollections or if he was contemporaneously oblivious. Either way, being unable to acknowledge and articulate the basic fact that race was — and remains — a concern for others is disturbing. The second thing: is he suggesting that we essentially stay silent and suck it up? Would that be an admirable strategy for overcoming oppression? It isn’t. This would be a particularly unsettling concept coming from a sitting justice who should be able to apply proper perspective to plaintive grievance and understand broad, societal circumstances. One thing that I will submit, however, is that the emphasis must shift from discussions of interpersonal racism — which I would argue are waning as they become more socially unacceptable — to systemic and institutional biases, which remain stubbornly infused throughout the culture. Interpersonal incidents of racism are easy to identify and condemn, particularly as their prevalence dwindles. We do hear too much about these at the expense of discussions about the systemic and institutional biases that are harder to see — it’s the old “can’t see the forest for the trees” problem — and that rarely have individual authors. This bias is obscured by anecdote but quite visible in the data sets. And, aside from Thomas’s swipe at liberals, I do in fact believe that he has been the target of racism, even in elite settings. But that’s the thing about racism: It’s no respecter of station. There is a tinted-glass ceiling that only a few can break through, and none without scarring. This upper-echelon bias can be particularly frustrating and galling for people who have the right gifts, make the right choices, go to the right schools and perform well at the right jobs, as the author Ellis Cose illustrated two decades ago in his brilliant book “The Rage of a Privileged Class: Why Are Middle-Class Blacks Angry? Why Should America Care?” You can’t individually achieve your way out of racism. The remedy is collective. As long as racism is operational, Justice Thomas’s fate is caught up with that of his racial compatriots. This kind of Talented-Tenth sniffing at the plight of the rest is privilege-blind. It views the condition of success as universal rather than unique, and ignores the inequities and obstacles that might prove more bedeviling or even insurmountable for those with similar gifts and good fortune, and certainly for those with less. We must stop having these juvenile discussions of race and face down the big questions: How can we help people see a thing so vaporous? How can we help direct dialogue among individuals about things happening on a grand scale? How can we help avoid victim and guilt fatigue in addressing problems whose formation was glacial and whose undoing is likely to be so as well? And how can we encourage people to fight on two fronts at once: holding the culture responsible for allowing and even nurturing roadblock biases, while still encouraging individuals to make every effort to overcome those biases, identifying and eliminating self-destructive behaviors? Simplistic discussions about race — both those that are history-blind and those that give insufficient weight to personal choices — do nothing to advance understanding. They obscure it.",836,851,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/blow-thomas-speaks-blindly-about-race.html,2014-02-13,Thomas Speaks ... Blindly About Race
0,,,153,article,"It seems logical: College graduates have lower unemployment and earn more than less educated workers, so, the thinking goes, the fix for today’s anemic growth in jobs and wages is to make sure that more people earn college degrees. But that’s a common misperception, deflecting attention from the serious work that has to be done to create jobs and improve incomes. A college education remains a path to more stable, higher-paying employment. The recent jobless rate for college graduates ages 25 and older was 3.2 percent, and their median pay at full-time, full-year jobs was $75,300 for men and $53,700 for women. That is a far lower rate of joblessness and a far higher pay level than for high school graduates and people without high school diplomas. But that doesn’t mean that enough good jobs are, or will be, available for college graduates. Though joblessness for college graduates ages 25 and older looks tame, the jobless rate for those under 25 averaged 8.2 percent in 2013, compared with 8 percent in 2012 and 5.4 in 2007, before the Great Recession hit in full force. Recent graduates also face rising underemployment, meaning that they work in jobs that typically do not require bachelor’s degrees. According to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the rise in underemployment for graduates ages 22 to 27 never fully retreated after the recessions of 2001 and 2007-9; in 2012, it was a dismal 44 percent for that age group, compared with a steady underemployment rate of 33 percent for college graduates as a whole over the past two decades. Pay, meanwhile, has stagnated for college-educated workers over the past 12 years. That’s better than declining, as has been the case for less-educated workers. But it also shows that a college education, in and of itself, does not create good jobs at good pay. For that, a thriving economy is essential — including consistent pro-employment policies and investments by business and government. Right now, the outlook for more good jobs at good pay is not good. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the 20 occupations expected to add the most new jobs from 2012 to 2022, only one — general and operations management — requires a bachelor’s degree. It also pays well — the median salary in 2012 was $95,440. Most of the other big-growth occupations offered very low or moderate pay, with the biggest growth areas generally being the worst paying, including home health care, retail sales and food service. The bureau also ranked the occupations that are expected to grow the fastest from 2012 to 2022. Of the top 20, seven require a bachelor’s degree or higher, including jobs as interpreters, information security analysts and health care professionals; median pay for those jobs in 2012 ranged from $45,430 for interpreters to $90,930 for physician assistants. Of the 13 fast-growing jobs that do not require a degree, most are in health care or building trades, with typical annual pay of about $20,000 to $30,000. All of which means that a major challenge for policy makers and business leaders is to confront the obvious: that most new jobs are likely to be lower-wage jobs. That requires plans for creating pathways from low-wage work to better-paying jobs, say from home health aide to vocational nurse, as well as strategies to foster the development of higher-paying industries. The situation also demands support for policies and institutions that lift wages, including a robust minimum wage and unions. On its own, more college won’t change the economy’s low-wage trajectory.",220,460,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/making-college-pay.html,2014-02-13,Making College Pay
0,nicholas,kristof,2399,article,"BOSTON — Emily, a 15-year-old ninth-grader, ran away from home in early November, and her parents are sitting at their dining table, frightened and inconsolable. The parents, Maria and Benjamin, both school-bus drivers, have been searching for their daughter all along and pushing the police to investigate. They gingerly confess their fears that Emily, a Latina, is being controlled by a pimp. I’m here to try to understand the vast national problem of runaways, and I ask if they have checked Backpage.com, the leading website for prostitution and sex trafficking in America. They say they haven’t heard of it. Since I’ve written about Backpage before and am familiar with how runaways often end up in its advertisements, I pull out my laptop — and, in two minutes, we find an ad for a “mixed Latina catering to your needs” with photos of a semi-nude girl. Maria staggers and shrieks. It’s Emily. A 2002 Justice Department study suggested that more than 1.6 million American juveniles run away or are kicked out of their home each year. Ernie Allen, a former president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, has estimated that at least 100,000 kids are sexually trafficked each year in the United States. Perhaps they aren’t a priority because they’re seen as asking for it, not as victims. This was Emily’s fourth time running away, and she seems to have voluntarily connected with a pimp. Based on text messages that her family intercepted, Emily was apparently used by a pimp to recruit one of her girlfriends — a common practice. “Made about 15 or 16 hundred,” Emily boasted to her friend in one text. “Come make money with me I promise u gonna be good.” So it’s true that no one was holding a gun to Emily’s head. Then again, she was 15, in a perilous business. And, in this case it turned out, having sex with a half-dozen men a day and handing over every penny to an armed pimp. A bit more searching on the Web, and we find that Emily has been advertised for sex in four states: Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut. The ads say that Emily (the name used in the ads, which is not her real name) is “fetish-friendly,” and that’s scary. Pimps use “fetish-friendly” as a dog whistle to attract deviants who will pay more for the right to be extra violent or abusive. “We don’t care what she did,” says Benjamin, in a shattered tone. “We just want her back.” The ads for Emily include a cellphone number to set up “dates,” and we pass the information to the authorities. The pimp’s phone number should make it easy to find the girl, so we wait to see what will happen. Maria is bitter that the police haven’t done more. She has been pleading for months for help, hounding the police — and now she finds that her daughter has been advertised in four states on multiple prostitution websites and no one seems to have checked or noticed. “I feel very strongly that it was racism,” Maria says. In fact, the Boston police force is admired nationally for its three-detective unit that fights human trafficking. This is the gold standard, yet, even here, a missing 15-year-old girl seemed to slip through the cracks. Every day, more than 4,000 children run away or are kicked out of their home — and there’s negligible interest. We feel outrage when Penn State or the Roman Catholic Church ignore child sexual abuse, but we, as a society, avert our eyes as well. Partly the problem is that many see sex trafficking as serious only when the victim is dragged off in chains; we don’t appreciate Stockholm syndrome or understand that often the handcuffs are psychological. Attitudes are changing, just as they have toward domestic violence, but too slowly. There are failings here beyond law enforcement. You wonder about the men paying to have sex with a girl who looks so young. About the hotel clerks. And about why we tolerate websites like Backpage.com that peddle teenage girls. A few hours after I sent police the link, officers located Emily in New Hampshire. Police raided a hotel, rescuing her and arresting a man, Andy Pena, 19, who, they said, was her pimp and took all the money she made. Police said that Pena was armed. Pena is in jail in New Hampshire; his public defender declined to comment. Emily is ambivalent about her rescue. She’s in a group home, getting support from other survivors of human trafficking through a group called My Life My Choice. She’s still rebellious, but it’s a good sign that she hugged her mom. Maria wept. Today Emily is safe, but there are hundreds of thousands of other runaways out on the streets. These are our kids, in danger. Shouldn’t they be a national priority?",6424,4099,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/kristof-when-emily-was-sold-for-sex.html,2014-02-13,When Emily Was Sold for Sex
0,michael,riordan,132,article,"EASTSOUND, Wash. — FROM where I live on Orcas Island in Puget Sound, north of Seattle, I can see Cherry Point across the wind-whipped waters of the Salish Sea. This sandy promontory jutting into Georgia Strait has become the focus of heated debate here in the Pacific Northwest. Peabody Energy, Carrix and other corporations hope to build a shipping terminal at Cherry Point to export nearly 50 million metric tons of coal to Asia annually. They ballyhoo the jobs the terminal may bring to our region but say nothing about the profits they will reap from selling subsidized coal. Opponents decry the prospect of the dirty, smelly, noisy trains blocking railroad crossings all across Washington State as they transport coal here from the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. They also warn that coal dust from the terminal will pollute nearby waters and harm our dwindling populations of herring, threatened Chinook salmon and endangered killer whales. But much larger issues of national and global concern are at stake. The low-sulfur Western coal, strip-mined from federal lands, is valuable public property. The federal government’s leasing of these lands at low cost to strip miners made some sense a few decades ago when the United States needed low-sulfur coal to reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide that was being emitted by coal-burning power plants and causing acid rain. But today, as utilities convert to cheap natural gas and American coal use declines, mining companies are seeking customers in China, Japan and Korea. Shipping this subsidized coal to Asian countries to help them power their factories, which undercut American manufacturers, makes little sense. Yes, this coal will help those countries produce cheap consumer goods for sale in stores across the United States. But it will also promote the continued transfer of industrial work to Asia, especially if the Trans-Pacific Partnership goes through. Is that good for American workers? The coal is extracted from federal lands so cheaply that taxpayers should be outraged. A 2012 study by the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis concluded that the government’s failure to obtain fair market value for coal mined in the Powder River Basin had deprived taxpayers of almost $1 billion annually over the past 30 years. Last year, the Interior Department’s inspector general similarly reported that the agency was failing to collect sufficient lease payments. And last week, the Government Accountability Office concluded that the coal leasing program run by the Bureau of Land Management operates without sufficient oversight to ensure that fair lease prices are being paid and does not fully account for export sales in evaluating these fees. “Taxpayers are likely losing out so that coal companies can reap a windfall and export that coal overseas, where it is burned, worsening climate change,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, who requested the study. When coal companies can strip mine Western coal for less than $10 a ton and sell it in Asia for nearly 10 times as much, lucrative profits can be banked all along the global supply chain. No wonder the Australian coal company Ambre Energy is planning to build two coal terminals on the Columbia River. In all, those terminals and the one proposed for Cherry Point could ship 100 million metric tons of coal to Asia annually. Asian nations hungry for energy have much looser pollution regulations and will pay dearly for coal, despite its noxious impacts on health and the environment. The health impact of coal emissions has recently become obvious in China, where this pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010, according to the Global Burden of Disease study, published in The Lancet, a British medical journal. And this pollution is unfortunately not confined to Asia. Wafted aloft on winds blowing across the Pacific, it reaches North America, depositing fine particles, mercury and other toxins on land and in water. Carbon dioxide emitted by burning coal adds inexorably to the global overburden of greenhouse gases warming the planet. Projected exports from Cherry Point alone could result in over 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. The gas has already begun to boost the acidity of near-shore waters, threatening Washington’s shellfish industry. The billions of tons of coal burned in Asia every year contribute markedly to global warming. Should the United States be selling them subsidized coal and encouraging this impending disaster? Our nation needs a new, transparent, clean-energy policy that no longer turns a blind eye to the many negative impacts of coal burning — or to companies trying to sell coal to other nations playing catch-up in the global economy. A cornerstone of this policy must be the rational use of our vast reserves of Western coal as we ramp down the overuse of what is, by far, the dirtiest fossil fuel. Is our economy to become a resource economy like Australia’s, exporting mineral wealth to Asia in return for mining and shipping jobs, plus cheap consumer goods? Should we support this Faustian bargain by selling our coal so inexpensively? What kinds of jobs and living conditions do we really want to foster, and where? These are questions a rational and much-needed, 21st-century energy policy would address. A great and growing plume of carbon dioxide continues to rise over Asia as transnational corporations are shifting manufacturing operations overseas. We can take a resolute stand at Cherry Point and begin to halt this boondoggle. A good first step would be one Senator Markey advocates: a moratorium on new coal leases.",537,472,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/opinion/dont-sell-cheap-us-coal-to-asia.html,2014-02-13,Don’t Sell Cheap U.S. Coal to Asia
0,norihiro,kato,89,article,"TOKYO —  One night in 1989, I got a phone call at home from someone who claimed to belong to the right-wing terrorist organization Sekihotai, the Blood Revenge Corps. He told me the group had put me on its blacklist of “anti-Japanese elements”; I was slated for assassination. In the previous weeks, I had published two opinion articles criticizing the recently deceased Emperor Hirohito, emphasizing his responsibility for World War II and questioning the deference he was being shown by the press and the population. I called our local police station. The officer I spoke with thought Sekihotai was a leftist group. I told him the organization seemed to have scouted out the building where I was living with my wife and two small children. All he did was dispatch two men to hook up a recorder to our phone. Within hours, our cat had destroyed the machine. I had reason to be worried. Two years before, in May 1987, Sekihotai had carried out a series of attacks on the Asahi newspaper, whose stance it considered to be “anti-Japanese.” One reporter was murdered with a shotgun; another was seriously injured. In a statement released at the time, the group said its mission was to “punish anti-Japanese elements inside and outside Japan” and that its actions against the Asahi were “only a first step.” In 1988, it sent a threat to former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for canceling a visit to Yasukuni Shrine out of consideration for the Chinese and Korean governments and another letter to Nakasone’s successor, Noboru Takeshita, demanding that he resume the visits. Sekihotai disappeared in 1990. To this day, no member of the organization has ever been identified, let alone arrested. My experience with the group — assuming the caller really was a member — was not the stuff of history books. The weeks of terror my family endured were a purely private affair: The police hardly did anything, and the newspaper that had printed my articles made clear that it did not wish to get involved. But the very privateness of that incident is telling. Just as my decision to criticize Hirohito as an ordinary man who had made catastrophic decisions, and to do so just as the entire country was mourning his death, made me part of a very small minority, so, too, it was with Sekihotai. Its extreme positions and its willingness to use violence relegated it to an almost-invisible fringe of society. And while I made my opinions public, Sekihotai’s members not only protected their anonymity, but also acted in secret. Right-wing rhetoric was a creature of the shadows. On those rare occasions when it broke out into the public sphere, it had an aura of deviance. Back in 1985, in the face of stiff popular opposition, the Nakasone administration had to abandon passing the State Secrets Bill, which would have made it possible to imprison people convicted of revealing information the government deemed sensitive. In 1986, Mr. Nakasone decided not to return to Yasukuni Shrine. Then he acceded to the Chinese government’s request that Japanese history textbooks be revised to reflect the aggressiveness of Japan’s colonial expansion during World War II. Recently, however, this once-deviant discourse has moved into the light. In fact, the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been doing some of the very things Sekihotai demanded of Mr. Nakasone and Mr. Takeshita. The government recently passed the so-called Special Secrets Protection Bill, which closely resembles the 1985 legislation. Abe recently became the first sitting prime minister since 2006 to visit Yasukuni Shrine. And he has announced his intention to disregard the protests of the Chinese and Korean governments against nationalist whitewashing in Japanese history textbooks. The sort of violent right-wing discourse that characterized Sekihotai is now all too familiar. Just look at visitors’ comments on Mr. Abe’s Facebook page. “Forget about those primitive Chinese and Koreans. The time has come to do battle with the anti-Japanese mass media (above all Asahi types),” says one, adding, “The primitive Chinese and Koreans have no influence anyway; the Japanese mass media, which go on brainwashing so many of the nation’s citizens, are infinitely worse. They’re a dauntless, hardy enemy, but this is a fight-or-die moment. Fight for us, Prime Minister Abe!!” The language’s virulence doesn’t quite come across in English. But the sentiment is clear enough. And the extent to which it resonates beyond the fringes of Japanese society is apparent from the large number of “likes” such comments garner, and on the Japanese prime minister’s Facebook page, of all places. A decade or so ago — some 12 years after the disappearance of Sekihotai — the leader of another Japanese right-wing organization speculated that the group had vanished because it had achieved its goals. That was giving it too much credit. Instead, a shift in the national mood has made such secret, shadowy groups unnecessary. Japan has taken a great turn to the right, and the descendants of Sekihotai are coming out into the open.

0,jochen,bittner,20,article,"HAMBURG, Germany —  All of a sudden, Germany says it wants to be a grown-up. “There are people who use Germany’s guilt in the past as an excuse for withdrawal and laziness,” President Joachim Gauck said at the opening of the 50th Munich Security Conference late last month. “This restraint can lead to a notion of being privileged, and if this is the case, I will always criticize it.” These are remarkable sentences, a direct challenge to Germany’s postwar pacifist edifice. They are of a historic piece with a famous speech by one of Mr. Gauck’s predecessors, Richard von Weizsäcker, in 1985. Then — 40 years after Germany’s capitulation in World War II — Mr. Weizsäcker said that the Germans should regard themselves as a liberated people. Now President Gauck is asking them for something more: Feel good about yourself — and feel responsible for others. Though Mr. Gauck, as president, has no formal power, he was not alone. A few minutes later, Germany’s new foreign and defense ministers said much the same in their own speeches. The foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, even repeated Mr. Gauck’s rhetoric: German contributions to international politics should come “earlier, more substantially and more decisively.” Officials familiar with the speeches told me that Mr. Gauck and Mr. Steinmeier had coordinated their approach well ahead of Munich. They had also informed Chancellor Angela Merkel. She chose to remain silent, but she, too, will soon have to show her colors. This is not what the world has come to expect from Germany, nor is it something Germany is entirely comfortable with. Commitments in Bosnia and Afghanistan aside, Germany has long failed to pull its weight in international affairs. Now, at least rhetorically, it may be taking up a political role commensurate with its outsized global economic power. Of course, the Munich rhetoric has to be translated into Berlin politics. And at this point, the one thing that Ms. Merkel wanted to avoid is almost certain to happen: a controversy within her newly formed governing coalition about what the new German responsibility actually means. Ask the coalition partners, the center-right Christian Democrats and Mr. Steinmeier’s center-left Social Democrats, how they imagine Germany’s new role, and the answers could not be more different. Social Democrats will tell you a lot about strengthening civilian crisis prevention, rethinking arms exports and generally being skeptical toward expensive defense projects. In contrast, Christian Democrats will emphasize the need to maintain and expand the capabilities of the German Army, in technical as well as in legal terms. Some even argue that the German Parliament should grant the army units a general mandate — that is, permission to use force without Parliament’s specific approval — if they do so within NATO or European Union structures. This last item is a necessary step if Germany is going to help create the nucleus of a true European defense capability and become, to use the fashionable German phrase, an “Ahnlehnungs partner” — roughly, a shoulder to lean on. Without unfettered leadership from Germany, European-level military operations will be hobbled. The multinational European Union battle groups, for instance, have never been used since their formation in 2005, although they could have been helpful in theaters like Mali or the Central African Republic. Why not? Because Germany, whose size gave it a virtual veto, never wanted them to be used. Unfortunately, the idea of loosening the army’s leash is extremely toxic to the Social Democrats. They could imagine, as a compromise, giving up parliamentary control once the European Parliament gets the right to approve military action. But this is a chicken-and-egg problem: A European Army mandated by the European Parliament will remain a distant fantasy without German participation. That said, the basic structures for such a role are quietly falling into place. On Jan. 1, the Dutch government put 2,100 soldiers under German command as part of a binational rapid-response force. Dutch soldiers, in other words, are happily receiving orders from German officers. A similar agreement is currently being discussed with the government of Poland. It is extraordinary to think of this happening 100 years after the outbreak of World War I. In fact, the Great War may contain the kernel of the kind of military synergy Germany could foster today, should Parliament step back. At the time, the German Army consisted of the forces of four kingdoms: Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Württemberg. During times of peace they were under the control of the local rulers; in wartime, like in 1914, they merged to defend the German empire. Germany could help lead the same sort of coordination today, albeit under democratic, European terms, not imperial ones. There remains a large divide between this sort of initiative and the political reality in Berlin. But it is what Europe needs, and it is what Germany needs to encourage, even if that means casting off its war-woven hair shirt. Mr. Gauck’s remarkable rhetoric in Munich has not made it easier, overnight, to implement his demand in practice, but the speech is a serious step forward into the realm of the politically possible. Ms. Merkel is, by all accounts, far from pleased with the message from Munich. The last thing she wants is a fight with the Social Democrats so early in her third term. But with the euro crisis receding, the two sides have no option but to grapple with the new European gauntlet thrown down by Mr. Gauck.

0,bahey,hassan,45,article,"CAIRO —  When Egypt’s military leaders gave Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi the go-ahead to run in the presidential elections, they set the stage for the next pharaoh, a leader who will rule with unchecked power in the tradition of Egypt’s earliest civilizations, and more recently personified by Hosni Mubarak, Anwar el-Sadat and Gamal Abdel Nasser. General Sisi will probably be elected by an overwhelming majority. Commentators who considered this an unacceptable interference of the military in politics seem to have forgotten that just last July, they — along with much of the  population — welcomed the army’s ouster of President Mohamed Morsi. That justified both the military’s intervention and its re-entry into politics as a response to the demands of the people. The Egyptian military has been hoisted up on the shoulders of tens of millions. Among its supporters are many of the politicians and youth activists who chanted “down to the military” and risked their lives in a 16-month confrontation following the 2011 revolution. Such a dramatic shift would never have been possible without the yearlong interlude that saw the dysfunctional and despotic government of the Muslim Brotherhood. After the 2012 elections, Egyptian and Western analysts alike predicted that the Brotherhood would remain in power for decades. After all, they reasoned, its Islamist approach mirrored the religious beliefs of the majority of Egyptians. But soon average Egyptians realized that the Brotherhood was not only imposing a vision of Islam different from their own, but it was leaving promises unfulfilled, and its officials were just as venal and dishonest as non-Islamist politicians. Mr. Morsi may have been Egypt’s first democratically elected president, but he governed like a caliph, operating as if he were entitled to unrestrained power. Just four months after he was elected by only 51 percent of voters, Mr. Morsi issued a constitutional declaration nullifying the checks on his power by the other branches of government. The military’s role as savior has been developed by manipulating citizens’ fears  and by capitalizing on conspiracy theories aimed at making Egyptians believe there is an existential threat to their country. On a daily basis, fictitious stories are disseminated widely in the media about various foreign agendas to undermine the Egyptian state, reinstate the Muslim Brotherhood regime, assassinate General Sisi, and dismantle the army, as in Iraq, Syria and Libya. This strategy has entranced many Egyptians, who fail to be outraged by the continuing mass killings and other abuses committed by the authorities against both Islamists and non-Islamists under the pretext of “fighting terrorism.” On Jan. 25, the third anniversary of the revolution, police  confrontations with demonstrators left some 103 people dead. Egypt has never ceased being a police state. Hazem el-Beblawi, the interim prime minister, says it “is run by the security bodies,” which control the presidency, cabinet, media and judiciary. Interrogations and court sessions take place in prisons, security directorates or police compounds. Eyewitnesses are no longer required to identify defendants. Warrants are issued by prosecutors after arrests. Brotherhood members are arrested based on their ranks in the organization rather than their involvement in crimes. When detainees ask to see a warrant, they may be hit over the head with the butt of a gun, as in the case of a leftist blogger, Alaa Abd El Fattah, and his wife, Manal. When a prominent international judge reviewed Manal’s account of the arrest, he described it as reminiscent of the days of apartheid in South Africa. In the midst of its clampdown on the Brotherhood, the security apparatus shifted its focus and began targeting non-Islamist youth activists, under the same pretext of “fighting terrorism.” At the end of January, the Justice Ministry established special courts to accelerate trials for “suspected terrorists”; peaceful demonstrators, too, are referred to these courts. Tarek Hussain, 20, was convicted last year of attacking the Brotherhood’s headquarters. Last month he was among dozens of young non-Islamist activists arrested as they demonstrated on the anniversary of the revolution. All were prosecuted as members of the Brotherhood. Sayed Weza, 18, a member of the liberal April 6 movement, also took part in these demonstrations and was killed. His last Facebook post said, “Please tell the coming generation that we loved our country!” Mr. Weza expressed his hope for future Egyptians, for his generation’s story is one of repression and crushed hopes. The youth boycott of the recent constitutional referendum sent the message that the solution for Egypt’s future will be found neither in a caliph nor in a pharaoh. Reinstating a police state will only lead to further instability as a new generation of Egyptian revolutionaries rises up to oppose repression.

0,mikheil,saakashvili,611,article,"NEW YORK — As the Winter Olympics begin in Sochi, a close Russian ally in Ukraine is suppressing and shooting pro-democracy protesters. One could be forgiven for thinking that the hour of triumph for autocrats and the retreat of democrats is at hand as the world gathers to celebrate the shining rule of Czar Vladimir. But do the Sochi Olympics really prove that President Vladimir V. Putin’s model of oil-fueled authoritarianism is the only one that can bring happiness and prosperity to Russia and the region? Though my country, Georgia, has almost no oil, it might hold the answer. For the last nine years, Georgia has been growing at a higher rate than Russia. Two years ago, I initiated unilateral visa-easing with Russia. Since then, more than one million Russians have come to visit. These predominantly urban middle-class visitors from a wealthier country came in part to admire Georgia’s much better services and infrastructure. Usually it’s the other way around: People from poorer countries go to the richer ones for that experience. Many Russian visitors can hardly believe that a small, once-impoverished, crime-ridden neighbor could develop all these new cities, with modern architecture and clean, safe streets. The secret is simple. Georgia has no oil, but it can offer something to its citizens and the world that Russia still cannot. It ranks No. 8 on the World Bank Index for “ease of doing business,” while Russia ranks 92nd. Russia is crippled by crime and corruption, but the European Union has consistently found Georgia to be the safest and one of the least-corrupt countries in the region, with a crime rate several times lower than Russia’s. Most importantly, Georgia is a democracy that went through a power transition in elections in 2012 and 2013 in which my party was defeated. If you want to understand the difference between Mr. Putin’s system and an open democracy, you need to compare the two Black Sea regions near the city of Sochi: Abkhazia and Adjaria. Abkhazia, which lies within Georgia’s internationally recognized borders, is just a few kilometers from Sochi. When Russia was bidding to be host of the Olympics, it had enthusiastic Georgian support, as we believed holding the Games in Sochi would enhance chances for peace and improve relations. Instead, several months after the Kremlin won its bid to host the Olympics, Russia invaded Georgia. The Kremlin sent in large numbers of troops and turned its previous de facto control of the region into an illegal military occupation. Since then, Russians have been busy erecting barbed-wire fences between Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia. Abkhazia’s capital, Sukhumi, is half in ruins; the only visible construction is on Russian military bases. More than 70 percent of Abkhazia’s pre-war population has been expelled and the place looks deserted and gloomy. Adjaria, just a few kilometers south of Abkhazia, is another Georgian region. In 2004, we managed to wrest it from the control of Mr. Putin and his local cronies. Since then, billions of dollars of foreign investment have transformed the place beyond recognition. Once backward and hopeless, it now has more new luxury hotels than Sochi and the atmosphere is much more relaxed and, needless to say, much safer. The number of tourists has risen tenfold and the population of its capital, Batumi, has doubled. Despite all the money lavished on Sochi, the results are far less than what you would expect. That’s because in the 21st century it takes much more to succeed than the Putin model. Building Potemkin villages is not going to restore Russia’s regional influence or have a positive impact on the neighborhood. Only real reforms, genuine modernization and an open society can achieve that. If Russia chooses that path, all its neighbors will rush to embrace it. Nor will the Olympics soothe the many historic grievances plaguing the region, or bring peace, as it was supposed to do. The Games are a one-time propaganda event. Ice-skating ballerinas cannot silence the real grievances of those left behind to clean up the mess after the party is over. The Games are being held on the site of a 19th-century genocide, in which almost all Circassians, the original inhabitants of the Sochi area, were methodically killed or expelled to Turkey. That wound has been kept alive by the Kremlin’s current approach toward the Circassians who remain in the region, and in its attitude toward other peoples of the North Caucasus. Russia’s leaders persistently refuse to treat people from Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria as equal citizens. The Kremlin regards their homelands as colonies where it has to buy off the elite and suppress the rest of the population. This attitude was vividly demonstrated in the last few months when Russian security forces increased mass arrests of young people and took saliva specimens from most Muslim women because the government believed that a woman from Dagestan was responsible for a suicide bombing that killed 16 people. Such a heavy-handed colonial approach can only antagonize and radicalize the population, undermining Russia’s efforts to maintain control of the region. Mr. Putin is also mistaken to think that the Olympics will shore up his hold on power. The last time Russia acted as host to the Games was back in 1980. The Olympics that year were meant to be a triumph of Soviet leadership and a demonstration of the superiority of their system. Unfortunately for them, soon after the Games ended, the turmoil that eventually led to the demise of Soviet Communism began to grow worse. There are some striking similarities with Sochi, which, like Moscow, was turned into a showcase for the system. The Soviet regime didn’t allow nonMoscovites to enter the city — just as people from the region are now being shut out of Sochi. Mr. Putin once called the dissolution of the Soviet Union the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, yet it seems he still fails to grasp why it happened. Just like Mr. Putin today, the Soviet leaders back then neglected the need for modernization, betting instead on consistently high energy prices. After 1980, falling oil prices and changes in technology led to the eventual meltdown of the Soviet Union. Today’s Russia is teetering on the edge of recession, despite its oil boom. More broadly, there is a fundamental contradiction between Mr. Putin’s effort to tighten the screws and restore the past, and the dreams of people in and around Russia who are striving for a better future. As a result, Mr. Putin’s fate might well be decided in the cold streets of Kiev rather than on the balmy slopes of Sochi.

0,thomas,edsall,126,article,"A passionate group of labor economists has taken up a cause championed 40 years ago by Senator Russell Long of Louisiana: to turn every worker into a capitalist. Long, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1966 to 1981, inherited a populist commitment from his father, Huey Long, the Louisiana governor who famously campaigned on the slogan “Every Man a King.” In 1973, Long became intrigued by the idea of granting corporations generous tax incentives to distribute stock to employees through Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs. Long’s question was, could ESOPs “make haves out of the have-nots without taking it away from the haves?” Working on assurances that this was indeed the case, Long said, “That’s the kind of populism I can buy.” Beginning in 1974, Long won enactment of a series of bills establishing tax incentives favorable to corporations that transferred company stock into ESOPs. In 2012, the National Center for Employee Ownership estimated that the number of ESOPs had grown to 12,000, covering 11 million workers with $858 billion in assets. Companies employing at least 10,000 workers with ESOPs include Publix Supermarkets; WAWA; WinCo Foods; and the employee-owned private equity firm, Alliance Holdings. After Long retired in 1987, however, some of the tax breaks he sponsored were eliminated or weakened as Democratic and Republican administrations sought new federal revenues to reduce the deficit. Robert Hockett, a law professor at Cornell, wrote in 2006 that ESOPs had expanded employee ownership of firms, but that “there is indeed a gap to be filled — that firm ownership remains nowhere near as widespread as home and human capital ownership.” Now three prominent labor policy experts have taken up Long’s cause. They are convinced that a major expansion of employee ownership is the most effective tool available to remediate inequality. The three experts -- Richard B. Freeman of the economics department at Harvard, and Douglas L. Kruse and Joseph R. Blasi, both professors at the School of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers – have been promoting worker capitalism in numerous papers and books. Together they edited “Shared Capitalism at Work: Employee Ownership, Profit and Gain Sharing and Broad-Based Stock Options” and last year they released “The Citizen’s Share: Putting Ownership Back into Democracy.” In “The Citizen’s Share,” Blasi, Freeman and Kruse make a broad, ideologically cross-cutting case on behalf of profit sharing and employee ownership: “It offers a new way to address the concentration of both economic and political power that many citizens believe is distorting the country. It offers a new perspective on how to fight the links between the Washington politicians, K Street lobbyists, big corporations, and political donors that fuel many Tea Party members’ opposition to government. It offers a new perspective on how to resolve the huge disparities in wealth and income.” They make the following specific arguments. First, they contend that policies promoting employee ownership have strong public support and that these policies reflect the convictions of the founders, including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Politicans on both sides of the partisan divide support ESOP proposals. Senators from the left, including Democrats Ben Cardin of Maryland, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and senators from the right, including Republicans Roy Blunt of Missouri, Pat Roberts of Kansas and John Thune of South Dakota, are, for example, co-sponsors of the Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2013. As far back as 1974, Ronald Reagan, then governor of California, strongly endorsed the concept, telling Young Americans for Freedom that “capitalism can work to make everybody a ‘have.’ ” In an analysis reminiscent of Russell Long’s, Reagan said: “Income, you know, results from only two things. It can result from capital or it can result from labor. If the worker begins getting his income from both sources at once, he has a real stake in increasing production and increasing output. One such plan is based on financing future expansion in such a way as to create stock ownership for employees. It does not reduce the holdings of the present owners, nor does it require the employees to divert their own savings into stock purchases.” Second, Blasi, Freeman and Kruse point out that there are already extensive mechanisms in place for employee ownership, not only formal ESOPs but also a variety of profit-sharing plans. Because of this, they argue, major innovations are unlikely to be needed; improvements in existing laws and practices should suffice. The authors cite responses to a question on employee ownership asked in a 2006 General Social Survey. The survey found that 47 percent of private-sector, full-time wage and salary workers now have access to some form of sharing in the firm where they work — cash profit sharing, cash gain sharing, employee stock ownership, employee stock options or ESOPs. Third, and most important, is the authors’ claim that it is economically advantageous to give employees an ownership stake in the firm for which they work. Blasi, Freeman and Kruse provide evidence that employees with some form of worker ownership accumulate more savings than employees in nonparticipating firms and that firms with some form of capital sharing perform better in the competitive marketplace than those that do not. They write that “workers with profit sharing or employee stock ownership are higher paid and have more benefits than other workers. This means that the substantial profit sharing and gain sharing and ownership stakes for the typical worker in these plans tend to come on top of, not in place of, fair fixed wages and benefits.” In addition, the authors cite studies showing sharp increases in productivity, higher employee morale, lessened turnover and fewer bankruptcies in corporations that adopt ESOPs. These findings raise a series of questions. If the various forms of worker capitalism or profit sharing produce such benefits, why hasn’t the free market itself forced every company to adopt similar plans? Asked about worker ownership, Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell and a specialist on issues concerning inequality, wrote in an email that he is “skeptical,” and cites his analysis of employee ownership in his book, “The Darwinian Economy,” in which he argues that if a worker-owned firm has all the advantages its proponents claim: “It would enjoy a prodigious competitive advantage. Since wages account for about 70 percent of a typical firm’s total cost, increasing productivity by 15 percent would reduce total cost by more than 10 percent. The firm could cut its prices by almost that amount and still remain profitable, which would enable it to peel off most of its rivals’ customers.” Frank pointed out that “any firm that enjoyed these advantages should sweep the market like a prairie fire, reaping enormous profits in the process.” Freeman addressed this question in a series of email exchanges with me. He began by noting that there is management opposition to profit sharing with rank and file employees “because the people who control the firm may have to take lower profits — if I am in charge of the firm and sharing profits with you raises productivity, but it means that I take less in profits, I will not favor going to a more shared system.” In addition, Freeman argued, “magnitudes are important.” The gains from employee share programs are modest, a “productivity edge of about 2 percent or so on average,” which may be trumped by other marketplace factors, including “some small monopoly advantage” held by competitors. Freeman emphasized that many liberal-left economists and policy makers are locked into the view that labor and capital are intractably adversarial. Consequently they “favor a European style big government/strong union solution to inequality” rather than solutions of a more cooperative nature such as ESOPs. Blasi, in a more detailed response, emailed that “both Democrats and Republicans until recently really believed that inflation-adjusted wage income growth or lowering taxes alone could maintain and grow the middle class.” In fact, Blasi argues, changing economic conditions dictate that “the sustaining of a middle class and mobility requires a capital ownership and a capital income policy.” In addition, Blasi writes, the “economic share policy tradition in American history has been sidelined by scholars in the modern and post-modern era. Until now, if you argued for ESOPs you were using ‘small ball’ ideas.” Liberal opposition to ESOPs is based in part on the view that the program amounts to a collection of tax subsidies for corporations and the wealthy. The tax breaks for ESOPs originally included a tax credit for company contributions: a deferral of taxes on shareholders who sell stock to an ESOP; deductibility of corporate dividends on ESOP-held shares; the exclusion from tax liability of 50 percent of the interest income from loans to an ESOP; and a 50 percent estate tax exclusion on the gain from the sale of shares to an ESOP. Blasi, Freeman and Kruse acknowledge that some critics see ESOPs as pioneering “a form of special-interest tax incentives from the Treasury.” Their counterargument: “We see the ESOP as the continuation of the Founders’ desire to reduce inequality and preserve democratic practices by extending property ownership to more Americans.” The Blasi-Freeman-Kruse proposal has the crucial political advantage of appealing to some on the political right because it would, in fact, make employee share programs more attractive by boosting tax subsidies — a form of cutting taxes. Most significantly, the Blasi-Freeman-Kruse proposal stands apart from alternate policy initiatives designed to address growing inequality because it directly addresses the concentration of wealth and political power at the top. For that reason alone, the idea of expanding employee ownership deserves serious consideration. The proposal does not resolve the question of how to give workers a sufficiently large share of capital to materially impact their economic status. Still, there are not that many viable options available to those who are committed to improving the disadvantaged position of labor versus capital. Politicians and policy makers cannot afford to disregard a proposal with demonstrable potential.",92,211,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/edsall-whatever-happened-to-every-man-a-king.html,2014-02-12,Whatever Happened to ‘Every Man a King’?
0,,,728,article,"The right to vote is the foundation of any democracy, yet nearly six million Americans are denied that right, in many cases for life, because they have been convicted of a crime. Some states disenfranchise more than 7 percent of their adult citizens. In an unflinching speech before a civil rights conference Tuesday morning, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. described this shameful aspect of our justice system for what it is: a “profoundly outdated” practice that is unjust and counterproductive. State laws that disenfranchise people who have served their time “defy the principles — of accountability and rehabilitation — that guide our criminal justice policies,” Mr. Holder said in urging state lawmakers to repeal them. “By perpetuating the stigma and isolation imposed on formerly incarcerated individuals, these laws increase the likelihood they will commit future crimes.” Felon disenfranchisement laws lie at the intersection of two issues on which Mr. Holder has become increasingly outspoken: criminal justice reform and voting rights. While he has no direct authority to change state laws, the weight of his words can help pave a path for legislative action in both Congress and statehouses around the country. In recent years, many states have made it easier to regain the right to vote after a conviction, either through legislation or by executive action. But a handful of states, particularly in the South, continue to be guided by the ghosts of the post-Civil War era, when disenfranchisement laws were aimed at newly freed blacks. The brunt of today’s laws that prohibit felons from voting still falls disproportionately on minorities, who make up more than one-third of those affected. In Florida, Kentucky and Virginia, more than one in five African-Americans cannot vote because of a conviction. Despite some progress, the United States remains an extreme outlier in allowing lifetime voting bans. Most industrialized nations allow all nonincarcerated people to vote, and many even allow voting in prison. Adding insult to injury, felon disenfranchisement laws — which are explicitly permitted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution — are devoid of both logic and supporting evidence. They undermine the citizenship of people who have paid their debt to society, and possibly at a cost to public safety. As Mr. Holder pointed out, a study by a parole commission in Florida found that formerly incarcerated people banned from voting were three times as likely to re-offend as those who were allowed to vote. Mass disenfranchisement also has serious political consequences. According to a 2002 study, disenfranchisement laws may have determined the outcome of seven Senate races — and thus control of the Senate throughout the 1990s — and a presidential election. While George W. Bush won Florida by 537 votes in 2000, more than 800,000 Floridians with criminal records were barred from voting. Regardless of which party might benefit most at the polls, repealing felon disenfranchisement laws is in the interest of upholding American ideals. And it has increasing bipartisan support; Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, Republicans who have promoted criminal-justice reform on a larger scale, are also pushing to scale back or end these laws. Even after someone has completed a sentence, Senator Paul said in September, “the punishment and stigma continues for the rest of their life, harming their families and hampering their ability to re-enter society.” Mr. Paul is wise to focus on the importance of re-entry, since 95 percent of incarcerated people are eventually released. The restoration of the right to vote should be automatic, as soon as a person is released from prison. There is no good reason to keep punishing people who have served their time by denying them the most fundamental democratic right.",2442,1332,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/6-million-americans-without-a-voice.html,2014-02-12,6 Million Americans Without a Voice
0,,,30,article,"Some 20 states have refused to expand their Medicaid programs to cover uninsured low-income people, an important element of the health reform law. Now several states that had been opposed, mostly for ideological reasons, are seeking to cover newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries through private insurance. They want to redirect the very generous federal matching funds that would be provided for expanding Medicaid and use the money instead to provide subsidies for eligible people to buy insurance on health care exchanges. The idea makes sense, politically and substantively, provided the coverage is comprehensive and there are safeguards to protect poor people from unaffordable premiums and co-payments. Using Medicaid funds to buy private insurance could give beneficiaries access to a wider group of doctors and ease the churn problem, in which patients are tossed back and forth between Medicaid and private coverage as their income changes. Expansion would also benefit millions of people below the poverty line who, because of a quirk in the health reform law, would otherwise be ineligible for coverage through either Medicaid or the exchanges. Federal health officials have approved waivers that allow Arkansas and Iowa to use Medicaid dollars to pay private insurers to provide the coverage, and similar waivers have been proposed or are under consideration for Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Utah and others. For states led by conservative Republican governors or legislators, this detour through private insurance coverage may be the only way to expand Medicaid to people who need it. But it will be a struggle from state to state to get this right. In Arkansas, the first state to adopt this approach, a Democratic governor and Republican-led Legislature agreed on a praiseworthy expansion last year, but changing political tides have thrown doubt on whether the this tactic to expand Medicaid will be continued. The state has already placed 83,000 Medicaid beneficiaries on the exchanges and was projected to enroll 250,000 in all. Every Medicaid beneficiary on an exchange plan is supposed to get all the benefits of traditional Medicaid and pay no greater cost-sharing. Some states in negotiating with the federal government for a waiver have tried to get special exemptions from other Medicaid requirements (which Arkansas did not get). For instance, Iowa asked for and got federal permission to avoid paying for nonemergency transportation to medical appointments, a standard Medicaid benefit, for a year, at which point federal officials will evaluate whether it has harmed beneficiaries’ access to care. Federal officials also compromised with the state on premiums it wanted to charge beneficiaries in private plans. The state was not allowed to charge premiums to people below the poverty line but was allowed to charge small premiums for beneficiaries above the poverty line, as was Michigan under a separate waiver. That has already triggered demands by Republicans in Arkansas to drop coverage of transportation costs and charge beneficiaries more. The uncertainty is whether expansion through private policies, which is supposed to be budget-neutral for the federal government, will end up costing more money than traditional Medicaid, which pays providers less than do private health plans. If so, states may seek to reduce the number of people covered or benefits provided, neither of which seems desirable. Even so, the risk seems worth taking. Persuading more Republican-dominated states to participate could greatly bolster political support for the health care reforms. Congressional Republicans might find it hard to damage a law that has support from both Republicans and Democrats at the state level.",52,93,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/medicaid-expansion-red-state-style.html,2014-02-12,"Medicaid Expansion, Red-State Style"
0,,,55,article,"As acceptance of gays and lesbians has grown in the United States and Europe, intolerance and persecution has been rising in other parts of the world. African nations are leaders in this cruel and dehumanizing trend. The latest alarms were triggered by a  ban in Nigeria on same-sex relationships that was passed by Parliament in May and signed by President Goodluck Jonathan on Jan. 7. Nigeria is a leading oil producer and Africa’s most populous country, and the ban is considered the most significant setback yet to gay rights on the continent. Although gay sex has been illegal in Nigeria since British colonial rule, the draconian new law criminalizes homosexuality, banning same-sex marriage and prescribing years in prison to anyone who makes a “public show” of same-sex relationships or participates in gay organizations. Even people who simply support gays are subject to criminal arrest and penalties. Before the new law was enacted, convictions for gay sex were rare in the southern part of Nigeria and occasional in the mostly Muslim north. But since the law went into effect, as Adam Nossiter has reported in The Times, arrests of gays have multiplied and some people have sought asylum overseas. According to Amnesty International, homosexuality is illegal in 38 of 54 countries in Africa. It carries the death penalty in Mauritania, Sudan and Somalia; in northern Nigeria, where Islamic law is practiced, the penalty can be death by stoning. In Senegal, the press regularly “outs” gays and same-sex relations carry a penalty of five years in prison. Another severe law has been passed by Uganda’s Legislature, but President Yoweri Museveni has not and should not sign it. Such laws violate commitments made by United Nations members in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights documents. If these nations cannot do the humane thing, they should at least consider their self-interest. For any leader who values stability, it makes no sense to promote new laws that foment greater hostility among people, like in Nigeria, where there is already ethnic tension. Even in countries where antigay laws are not enforced, they provide an excuse for abuse — including blackmail and extortion — by police, Amnesty International said. It is unlikely that any of these countries can reach their full economic potential because many foreign entities may find it too risky to invest in such hostile environments. These governments, in abusing their citizens, are moving in dangerous and destructive directions.",95,142,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/demonizing-gays-in-africa.html,2014-02-12,Demonizing Gays in Africa
0,thomas,friedman,435,article,"I’ve written a series of columns from Israel in the past two weeks because I believe that if Secretary of State John Kerry brings his peace mission to a head and presents the parties with a clear framework for an agreement, Israel and the Jewish people will face one of the most critical choices in their history. And when they do, all hell could break loose in Israel. It is important to understand why. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not without reason, is asking the Palestinians to recognize Israel as the “nation state of the Jewish people,” confirming that if Israel cedes them a state in the West Bank, there will be two-states-for-two-peoples. But, for Netanyahu to get an answer to that question, he will have to give an answer to a question Israelis have been wrestling with, and avoiding, ever since the 1967 war reconnected them with the heartland of ancient Israel, in the West Bank, known to Jews as Judea and Samaria. And that is: “What is the nation state of the Jewish people?” Kerry, by steadily making the answer to that question unavoidable, has set the whole Israeli political system into a roiling debate, with some ministers shrilly attacking Kerry and slamming Netanyahu for even putting the question on the table — as if the status quo were sustainable and just hunky-dory. For instance, Kerry recently observed at a conference in Munich that if the current peace talks failed “there’s an increasing delegitimization campaign that’s been building up [against Israel]. People are very sensitive to it. There are talks of boycotts and other kinds of things.” Some Israeli ministers and American Jewish leaders blasted Kerry for what they said was his trying to use the B.D.S. movement — “boycotts, divestment and sanctions” — as a club to pressure Israel into making more concessions. I strongly disagree. Kerry and President Obama are trying to build Israelis a secure off-ramp from the highway they’re hurtling down in the West Bank that only ends in some really bad places for Israel and the Jewish people. I like the way Gidi Grinstein, the founder of the Reut Institute, a nonprofit that works on the thorniest problems of Israeli society, puts it: “We are in a critical moment in our history — far more significant than many realize.” Ever since 1936, “the Zionist movement has sought to establish a sovereign Jewish and democratic majority in Zion, and, therefore, eventually accepted the principle of two-states-for-two-peoples: a Jewish state and an Arab state.” Although there is a powerful settler movement in Israel that would like to absorb the West Bank today, the State of Israel has continued to tell the world and the Jewish people that, under the right security conditions, it would cede control of that occupied territory and its 2.5 million Palestinians and forge a two-state deal. If Kerry’s mission fails — because either Israelis or Palestinians or both balk — he will either be tacitly or explicitly declaring that this two-state solution is no longer a viable option and “that would plunge Israel into a totally different paradigm,” said Grinstein, who recently authored the book “Flexigidity: The Secret of Jewish Adaptability.” It would force Israel onto one of three bad paths: either a unilateral withdrawal from parts of the West Bank or annexation and granting the Palestinians there citizenship, making Israel a binational state. Or failing to do either, Israel by default could become some kind of apartheid-like state in permanent control over the 2.5 million Palestinians. There are no other options. But what these three options have in common, noted Grinstein, is that they would lead to a “massive eruption of the B.D.S. movement” and “the B.D.S. movement at heart is not about Israel’s policies but Israel’s existence: they want to see Israel disappear. What is keeping the B.D.S. movement contained is that we’re still in the paradigm of the two-state solution.” If that paradigm goes, he added, not only will the B.D.S. movement launch with new momentum, but the line between it and those around the world who are truly just critical of Israel’s West Bank occupation will get blurred. Furthermore, being the “nation state of the Jewish people,” means that the values of Israel cannot be sharply divergent from the values of the Jewish diaspora (the vast majority of American Jews vote liberal) or from the values of America — Israel’s only true ally. Added Grinstein: “If that happens, the relationship between Israel and America and American Jewry will inevitably become polarized.” To avoid that, no one expects Israel to concede to whatever Palestinians demand or to accept insecure borders or to give Palestinians a free pass on their excesses. And Kerry is not asking that. Israel should bargain hard and protect its interests. “But Israel has to be seen as credibly committed to ending its control over the Palestinians in the West Bank,” concluded Grinstein, otherwise it won’t just have a problem with B.D.S., but eventually with America and a growing segment of American Jews  — “turning Israel from a force of unity for Jews to a force of disunity.” So responding to the Kerry plan, when it comes, is about something very deep: What is the nation state of the Jewish people — and how will Jews abroad and Israel’s closest ally, America, relate to it in the future?",723,647,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/friedman-israels-big-question.html,2014-02-12,Israel’s Big Question
0,bob,garfield,82,article,"CALL me obtuse, but I was surprised when President Obama, running for re-election two summers ago, declared that Costco is “representative of what America is all about.” It is? More than the Marshall Plan or the Bill of Rights? Or Walmart? Well, now things are confusing because Costco also got a shout-out in the State of the Union address as a shining discount-warehouse on the hill — but the meaning-of-America encomium was now conferred on the rewards of capitalism: “Americans understand that some people will earn more money than others, and we don’t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success. That’s what America’s all about.” Well, why not? Horatio Alger. The American dream. The president wasn’t saying something that hadn’t been said before. The trouble is, he keeps changing his story. Just two days later, in Nashville, Mr. Obama was anointing, as our defining quality, not the big payday but educational opportunity: “Now, giving every student that chance — that’s our goal. That’s what America is all about.” Really? Two weeks earlier, in Raleigh, N.C., the president had offered a different formulation for American-ness: R & D. “And that’s what America is all about,” he declared. “We have always been about research, innovation, and then commercializing that research and innovation so that everybody can benefit.” Talk about “about face.” Any day now, he will say America is all about nougat. On sundry occasions, the president has cited quality manufacturing, military service, freedom from discrimination, community service and succeeding from humble beginnings as the unique characteristic that explains our nation. Goodness gracious, Hamlet dithered less. But I’m not blaming Mr. Obama for a podium reflex. That’s not what I’m about. When it comes to turning every issue into a matter of fundamental Americanism, the Definer in Chief has no monopoly on glib reductions of the national essence. A swift survey finds that “what America is all about” is also: ignoring educated elites (Thomas Sowell); Condoleezza Rice’s career (John McCain); exceptionalism (Fred Thompson); amoral ambition (William Gaddis); community service (Penny Pritzker); and gun ownership (The American Spectator). The exercise seems to be something of a Rorschach test, telling us more about the American than America itself. Take Terry Thompson, a man quoted last December by Bloomberg News, who believes the Detroit autoworker is what America is all about. Mr. Thompson is a Detroit autoworker. The impulse for reductiveness is like one of those stick-on closet lights: seldom very illuminating. Obviously, America is about many things: political freedom, economic opportunity, the melting pot, cat videos, the cult of celebrity, the cult of the military, franchised inauthentic ethnic cuisine, “super PACs” and 89 brands of riding mower. But none of them singularly defines the American way. The question really is, what is America all about that is truly distinctive? Helping others less fortunate is a genuinely American impulse, but it ranks high in Norway, too. Likewise, the notion of exceptionalism: We may deem the American way, in peace and war, to be a cut above, but a similar sense of self-regard runs pretty high in Serbia, I hear. And let us not even discuss French chauvinism, the finest in the world. To divine our one true essence, should we not settle on a list of defining institutions both transcendent and rare? I humbly propose the following: the Constitution, Nasdaq ... and Costco.",76,133,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/what-is-america-all-about.html,2014-02-12,What Is America All About?
0,kevin,corbit,450,article,"PULLMAN, Wash. — CLINICALLY speaking, about 1.5 billion people worldwide are overweight. According to the World Health Organization, more than 10 percent of the world’s adults are obese, arguably making them the largest patient population in existence. We can debate the causes, but the long-term consequences of obesity — diabetes, heart disease, cancer — place huge burdens on our society. Public health campaigns have made little impression on this spreading medical crisis. The biotechnology industry, where I work, strives to develop therapies for the greatest unmet medical needs. Can it provide a solution to a problem for which, so far, there have been few clinical responses? Only three drugs are currently approved for long-term treatment of obesity; they promote moderate weight loss and often have significant side effects. Why don’t we have better options? It’s not as if very smart people with lots of resources aren’t trying. A major concern when developing medications to treat obesity is that drug testing, for the most part, is limited to using highly formulaic rodent models. These laboratory animals are genetically and environmentally manipulated to mimic human weight gain, and do not reproduce certain adverse drug events — such as suicidal ideation — that can be encountered when tested in humans. The result is a plethora of mice and rats that are metabolically healthy thanks to the drugs, while about a fifth of the world’s population and more than a third of Americans stay overweight. So maybe we’ve been on the wrong track. An alternative approach looks at whether nature, through millions of years of evolutionary experimentation, has already figured out how to appropriately cope with biological threats. Many fascinating examples exist. A diminutive rodent, the grasshopper mouse, is resistant to the excruciating sting of the bark scorpion. For longevity, nothing can top the naked mole rat, which is naturally resistant to types of pain, cancer and, possibly, Alzheimer’s disease. After weeks of fasting, Burmese pythons are able to enlarge their hearts by as much as 40 percent within two to three days of eating in order to accommodate the increased metabolism — a degree of cardiac hypertrophy that would be a leading predictor of mortality in humans. All of these animals have evolved ways to overcome conditions considered pathological in humans through unique mutations in key genes. I believe nature has even figured out how to convert profound obesity into a benign state. Enter my object of study: the grizzly. Hibernation by bears is an astonishing feat of evolution. After an epic period of late-summer gorging, during which, every day, a bear may consume more than 50,000 calories and gain up to 16 pounds, it will fast for up to seven months. Then it subsists solely on stored fat, without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating. Bears also shut down their renal function during hibernation, resulting in badly scarred kidneys and high levels of blood toxins that would kill a human. What is truly remarkable is that the bears’ kidney failure is reversible: Upon awakening from hibernation, their kidney function is fully restored with no lasting damage. These observations make bears a veritable cornucopia of biological discovery. The problem, of course, has been to figure out how to practically and safely study 700-pound animals with uncommon strength and a reputation for being surly. Luckily for me, Charles T. Robbins at Washington State University has spent 28 years working out how to house rescue grizzlies and have them hibernate in captivity. Collaborating since 2011, we have discovered some fascinating features of bear metabolism that may lead to valuable innovations in treating obesity. (My company has invested in our research.) We started by asking if the unparalleled gains in weight and body fat necessary to survive hibernation are accompanied by consequences, like diabetes, that are typically observed in humans. The type of diabetes associated with human obesity is a result of the body’s inability to respond to the hormone insulin and so is referred to as “insulin resistance.” In a healthy human, an injection of insulin will cause a drop in blood sugar as the hormone facilitates the transport of sugars from the blood into cells, where it is either used to produce energy or stored as fuel. In a diabetic subject, the cells fail to respond to the insulin and their blood sugar stays high — with long-term effects like obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. But bears are able to modulate their insulin responsiveness, so that when they are most obese, in the fall, they are most insulin sensitive. In other words, even as they pile on the pounds, their cells retain the capacity to take instructions from insulin. Just weeks later, the bears render themselves completely insulin resistant while in hibernation; they become, in essence, diabetic. But hibernating bears differ from diabetic humans in that they maintain normal blood sugar levels while in this insulin-resistant state. Once they wake, in the spring, the grizzlies restore their insulin responsiveness. So bears modulate insulin sensitivity not to maintain normal blood sugar levels but to control when fat is stored and when it is broken down. Put another way, bears naturally and reversibly succumb to diabetes. Since we know when they make this switch, we hope to pinpoint how they do this. Grizzlies also handle obesity in a much different manner than humans — without tissue inflammation or storing fat where it does harm. Bears store their winter fuel only in fat tissue, not in the liver or in muscle, as occurs in humans with pathological obesity. These findings suggest that bears have mastered a kind of “healthy” maintenance obesity — despite huge fat accumulation, weight gain and perpetually high cholesterol. This phenomenon of healthy obesity may also occur in a small number of humans with specific mutations in a gene known as PTEN, such that, while obese, they remain exquisitely sensitive to insulin. Thus humans with this mutation are quite grizzly-like in their metabolism. Interestingly, we have found that bears control the activity of PTEN, the protein encoded by the PTEN gene, in a manner similar to a dimmer switch, cranking the activity up and down at specific times of the year to control how responsive to insulin they are. As we know exactly when bears modulate PTEN activity and where (in fat cells), we expect to discover the mechanism. Millions of years of evolutionary experimentation have produced genetic adaptations that enabled bears to cope with obesity, converting it to a benign state in which weight gain has much-reduced health threats. If nature has figured this stuff out for grizzlies, maybe we can for humans.",1313,1038,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/a-grizzly-answer-for-obesity.html,2014-02-12,A Grizzly Answer for Obesity
0,,,5,article,"The owners of a Bangladeshi factory, Tazreen Fashions, where a fire killed 112 workers in late 2012, surrendered to the police on Sunday and are expected to face trial on charges of negligence. Justice has often been delayed and denied in Bangladesh. It has been particularly out of reach for workers in the country’s powerful garment industry, which employs about four million workers and sells billions of dollars of clothes to Western retailers like Walmart, Gap and H&M. The industry has an abysmal safety record. Fires in factories have killed hundreds of garment workers in Bangladesh in recent years. Yet legal experts say the owner of Tazreen, Delowar Hossain and his wife, Mahmuda Akther, who was also a director at the company, may be the first executives in the country to be charged with a crime related to a factory fire. Another group of executives linked to Rana Plaza, a building that collapsed in April 2013 and killed more than 1,100 workers, have also been arrested and are awaiting a trial that is expected to begin this year. Initially, the police in Bangladesh said that they did not have enough evidence to bring a case against Mr. Hossain. But a court ordered officials to investigate further after human rights activists filed a lawsuit. That investigation found that managers closed doors to prevent workers from escaping and determined that none of the factory’s fire extinguishers had been used. Witnesses also said many workers died because the factory’s windows were covered by iron grilles, which are often installed by owners to deter theft even though they pose a grave safety risk. Mr. Hossain has denied any responsibility and said he plans to plead not guilty. That Mr. Hossain and Ms. Akther are in police custody shows progress. But it’s just one step in what is sure to be a long process.

0,paul,vallely,93,article,"LONDON —  Boys have been raped. Priests have lied. Bishops have been complicit in cover-ups. Evidence has been shredded, whistle-blowers undermined, silence has been bought and victims given false promises. And yet for all that, the blistering critique of the United Nations report on sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church may end up doing more harm than good. The case against the church is clear. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child refers to tens of thousands of crimes by priestly abusers over several decades. It calls on the church to remove all abusers from active ministry, report them to the police and open its archives on the 4,000 cases which have been referred to the Vatican. But the report naïvely, or ideologically, also blundered into a wider attack on Catholic teachings on contraception, homosexuality and abortion. That prompted the Vatican to respond with a forceful counterattack claiming the United Nations has gone beyond its proper area of competence — and, indeed, has violated the safeguards on religious freedom in its own Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The focus on child abuse has been lost in the row, with Vatican apologists tweeting about the Holy See being ambushed by a kangaroo court. The United Nations process, some said, had been driven by NGOs with an anti-Catholic agenda on reproductive rights. Dark remarks were made about getting the General Assembly to impose a code of conduct on United Nations human rights committees to make them more accountable. All this has shifted attention from the key question: Is the church doing enough to deal with the abuse? Yet that is not the only reason that the United Nations committee may have made a tactical blunder by attacking wider Catholic values. For all the unified public pronouncements from church spokesmen, the reality is that behind the scenes the Vatican is deeply divided on the issue. Some top church officials hold to the feeble nicety that the Holy See can only be held to account by the United Nations for what goes on in the limited territory of the Vatican city-state. Their argument, that they only have spiritual rather than juridical authority over the rest of the church, is deeply unconvincing to most outsiders. Religious superiors are bound by an oath of obedience to the pope, so there is a clear line of institutional accountability, and others in the Roman Curia know that. The other big division inside the Vatican is on the issue of whether offending priests should be reported to the police or dealt with by internal procedures. The United Nations report implies that the Vatican has done little to address the decades-long abuse scandal. But the truth is that it has taken significant steps in recent years. From 2001 it insisted that all priestly abuse cases be referred to Rome, where they were handled at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith by the man who later became Pope Benedict XVI and who took an increasing hard line on the issue. In the final two years of his papacy he more than doubled the number of offenders being dismissed from the priesthood to almost 400. But his early instinct was to handle matters behind closed doors. Only in 2010 did Benedict instruct dioceses to report suspect priests to the police and order local bishops to draw up new guidelines to protect children. The procedures set in place in Britain after a report by Lord Nolan, the former chairman of that country’s Committee on Standards in Public Life, have become a worldwide benchmark on child protection. In America, background checks on adults and safe environment education for millions of Catholic children and church workers have seen cases of clerical sexual abuse tumble. But elsewhere bishops have been slow to act. In Italy, anti-abuse guidelines were adopted only last month and they do not instruct bishops to report suspect priests to the police. Other bishops — in Africa, Asia and Latin America — have claimed, implausibly, that there are no sex abuse problems there. Pope Francis last year announced a new church commission on the protection of minors. But he has yet to name its members or say what their brief will be. The pope’s views are unclear. As an archbishop in Argentina, he took a hard line, saying offenders should be defrocked, and ridiculing the practice elsewhere of simply moving pedophile priests to new parishes. But he did not advocate involving the police, which is a key requirement of many victims groups, and on which the United Nations report has insisted. In his first 11 months, Pope Francis has not once spoken publicly at any length on the issue. In private he has told officials of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to act decisively. But an archbishop and nuncio accused of sexually abusing boys in the Dominican Republic was not reported to the police there; instead he was recalled to the Vatican for prosecution. Francis has sent mixed signals on what his new commission will do. Some officials suggest it will merely offer advice on prevention, psychiatric evaluation and the improved pastoral care of victims rather than offering new procedures for exposing and prosecuting abusers. But on Jan. 31 the pope told members of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that they may soon be working with the new commission, suggesting it may have a prosecutor role. What the United Nations report made clear is that to restore public faith in the church on this issue the pope must make reporting of offenders to the local police mandatory — and be prepared to discipline any bishop who fails to comply. The sad irony is that the attack on wider Catholic values may have amplified the voices inside the Vatican of those who are advising him not to opt for full public transparency. If he heeds them, Pope Francis risks becoming part of the problem instead of part of the solution.

0,masha,gessen,71,article,"IT was the quintessential immigrant moment. Two weeks after my family and I had arrived in New York, a friend drove me to Costco. Half an hour later, at the cash register, I was hidden from view by the pyramid of diapers, napkins and other paper products in the shopping cart. My friend laughed and snapped a picture, promising to post it online with the caption, “Masha comes to America.” And then my debit card did not work. This wasn’t just any card; it was a Citibank gold card, the kind that warrants a special line at the bank’s offices and obsequiousness from the tellers. And it was linked to the account that, for the moment, held all my money: We had sold our apartment in Moscow, jumped through an assortment of Russian tax hoops and transferred the proceeds to the United States, where we now lived. It made me nervous to have all that money sitting in one virtual clump in the bank — but not nearly as nervous as having the card connected to it not work. The experience was also humiliating. In one moment, I had gone from being a Citigold client to a deadbeat immigrant who couldn’t pay for her son’s diapers. I called Citibank as soon as I got home. “Your account has been closed,” a woman informed me, without a hint of that special precious-metal politeness. “When? Who closed it?” I was working hard not to sound belligerent. “And where is my money?” I could hear the woman tapping on her keyboard indifferently, as she was figuring out where all the money I had in the world was. I whispered to my partner that the account had been closed and the money was gone. “It’s the Russian tax police,” she whispered back. That made perfect sense. As a journalist I had investigated similar scams perpetrated by the Russian tax police on a far grander scale. And I had reported this transfer, including the amount and all the account details, to the Russian tax authorities. Except that it wasn’t the Russian tax police that had closed my accounts (there were two). It was Citibank. “I see that because your transactions indicated there may be an attempt to avoid complying with currency regulations, Citibank has closed your account,” the woman informed me. There was now a distinct note of steel in her voice. “But why did no one contact me? If they had, I would have submitted the documents showing that the money came from the sale of an apartment, and all tax obligations have been met.” I was babbling, and the details were no longer important. “Where is my money?” “A cashier’s check for the full amount of money contained in your accounts has been sent,” the woman said. “Why wasn’t I notified?” “The cashier’s check will serve as your notice.” Citibank had fired me as a client. For several nerve-racking days my nest egg, my children’s future college tuition — every penny I had — resided in a cashier’s check that was wending its way through the United States Postal Service. It finally arrived with a terse note informing me that I had been told “in a previous letter” that Citibank could no longer have me as a client. I had gotten no previous letter, and this one came from the Client Escalation Unit — about as far from the grace of gold-card status as a customer can fall. I wasn’t entirely surprised. This had happened to other Russian-Americans I know, including one of my closest friends and my father. My friend had opened her account at a local bank in the United States when she got her first job, at age 13. Her accounts were summarily closed in 2008, while she was working in Russia. The bank, which had been bought by Sovereign in the meantime, would not state a reason for firing a client of 27 years. My father, who immigrated to the United States in 1981, had his accounts closed by BankBoston in 2000, when he was a partner in a Moscow-based business. His lawyers pressed the bank on the issue and were eventually told that because Russians had been known to launder money, the bank applied “heightened scrutiny” to accounts that had a Russia connection. It had closed “many” accounts because of what it considered suspicious activity. Like other kinds of ethnic profiling, these policies of weeding out Russian-Americans who have money are hardly efficient. Russians who launder money don’t do it by transferring large amounts between personal accounts opened in the same name and in plain view of all the relevant authorities. They channel the money through businesses registered in offshore zones, usually under names culled from pop songs or romantic comedies. When I took my cashier’s check to a new bank, I felt trepidation and made sure to say nothing about Russia.

0,,,9,article,"In the last four days, at least 800 people — mostly women, children and the elderly — have been evacuated from Homs, one of Syria’s most embattled cities in what was an important, yet pathetically incomplete, humanitarian pause in the fighting. Brokered by the United Nations, the pause has been extended until Wednesday, giving more civilians a chance to escape the relentless bombardment and deprivation. At best, the evacuation is likely to save only a fraction of the civilians in danger. Thousands more remain in Homs, and millions more around the country are under attack and being denied food, medicine and other necessities. Meanwhile, even with the truce, civilians and aid workers remain at serious risk. Over the weekend, mortar rounds and gunfire struck near aid convoys, damaging vehicles and leaving victims lying in the streets. And while civilians are theoretically protected under international law, many were exposed to sniper fire as they fled. Others, fearing that those left behind would be massacred, refused to leave. The United Nations’ humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, condemned both the army and rebel forces, saying that United Nations and Syrian Red Crescent workers had been “deliberately targeted.” The United Nations Security Council has failed to respond to the bloodshed, largely because of Russia’s slavish allegiance to President Bashar al-Assad. It must at least find the resolve to improve on the pause and extend it to other population centers. Later this week, it is expected to entertain a resolution that would pressure the government and the rebels to allow organizations delivering humanitarian aid to operate freely; providing supplies to civilians and giving them the means to escape seems an acceptable response. A political solution leading to a transitional government remains the best outcome, but it is a long shot. While a first round of peace talks in Geneva ended inconclusively 10 days ago, Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations’ mediator, was right to convene a new round on Monday. And a political solution is not out of the question if some right choices are made. The United States, for one, should drop its opposition to including Iran, which supplies arms and other assistance to Mr. Assad, in the negotiations. Russia, another weapons supplier, could send a powerful message to Mr. Assad by suspending its arms deliveries. Saudi Arabia and Qatar could send the same message to Mr. Assad’s opposition by ending weapons deliveries to the rebels. And Turkey could close its border to the foreign fighters that have turned Syria into a cauldron of extremist elements that threaten the entire region. Synchronizing all these moving parts will not be easy, but the tragedy in Homs is just one more reason the effort should be made.",13,21,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/the-message-from-homs.html,2014-02-11,The Message From Homs

To the list of good proposals unveiled in his first month — an ambitious surge in affordable apartments, a tax increase to pay for universal prekindergarten, expanded paid sick leave — Mr. de Blasio added some new ones. He wants Albany to allow New York City to raise its minimum wage and wants to require city-subsidized employers to pay a higher-than-minimum “living wage.” These are two excellent ideas, though the minimum-wage increase sets up a likely confrontation with Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature, a challenge for a mayor who has yet to persuade Albany to approve his preschool tax. Mr. de Blasio also revived a proposal to create a government-issued ID card for all city residents. This would allow undocumented immigrants to file police reports, access government services, sign leases and borrow library books, among other things. Such an exercise in immigrant integration has worked in cities like New Haven and San Francisco. It is worth trying on a New York-size scale. Mr. de Blasio’s handful of good ideas whetted the appetite for more. But his societal critique and statements of noble ambitions — “We will look to the innovation economy not just to grow companies, but also to put New Yorkers to work.” — used up much of the space that would have been better occupied by details of a broader agenda. People curious about what’s planned for, say, parks, sanitation, transportation, the arts, infrastructure and climate change, were not given a lot to go on. To drive home his anti-elitist message, Mr. de Blasio made his speech a tribute to Fiorello La Guardia, “the people’s mayor.” He gave it at LaGuardia Community College in Queens, and he was introduced by Mr. La Guardia’s granddaughter. Riffing on his predecessor’s nickname, Mr. de Blasio said his job was getting all of New York’s “little flowers” to grow “to their fullest potential.” The same could be said of his budding administration.",16,19,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/the-state-of-mr-de-blasios-city.html,2014-02-11,The State of Mr. de Blasio’s City
0,,,13,article,"War profiteering is presumably as old as warfare. But the costly fraud that Army officials recently disclosed to Senate investigators seems especially shameful. It took place on the home front and corrupted a supposedly legitimate special program to increase the number of recruits during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. More than 1,200 people are under investigation, including 200 military officers, for allegedly defrauding a program that paid cash bounties for drawing enlistees into service. Working with collaborators in the military, the suspects falsely claimed rewards for recruiting men and women who had already committed to serve. Military investigators have estimated that the fraud could cost taxpayers as much as $100 million and will take another two years to fully map. The Recruiting Assistance Program paid bonuses from $2,000 to $7,500 per recruit and was considered a success by the Pentagon for attracting 130,000 new recruits at a cost of $300 million. But, according to Senate testimony, civilians, including high school counselors, cashed in by taking credit for recruiting students they knew, from school records, would be joining up anyway. In one scam, five people split about $1 million in bonuses as the program, created in 2005, was bilked for years without detection. Another fraud artist bagged $244,000 in bounties before he was caught and sentenced to prison. “These are criminals that have dishonored the uniform we are all so proud of,” noted Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat of Missouri. Though the program was suspended in 2012, lawmakers and taxpayers must demand the fullest accounting of this blot on the home front, however war-weary the nation is.",12,27,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/army-auditors-shock-and-awe.html,2014-02-11,Army Auditors’ Shock and Awe
0,,,31,article,"Since the Supreme Court struck down the provision in the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples, the Justice Department has been helping federal agencies change their practices. Now the department is adjusting its own policies and programs, bringing significant advances for gay couples and American justice. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. on Saturday unveiled a bold effort by his department to eliminate the distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex married couples in the federal justice system. On Monday, he issued a formal policy memo instructing employees that it is the Justice Department’s policy “to recognize lawful same-sex marriages as broadly as possible” and “treat all individuals equally regardless of sexual orientation.” What that means in concrete terms, for example, is that in court cases and criminal investigations, same-sex couples will be covered for the first time by the “spousal privilege,” a rule that prevents spouses from being forced to testify against each other. Same-sex spouses of police officers or firefighters killed or catastrophically injured in the line of duty will be eligible for a special benefits program the Justice Department administers. Same-sex couples will be recognized by the department when determining eligibility for payments from the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, which is for people injured or made ill by the 2001 terrorist attacks. The Federal Bureau of Prisons must grant to federal inmates in same-sex marriages the rights and privileges given other married inmates. That includes equal visitation by a spouse and eligibility for compassionate release or a reduction in a sentence when an inmate’s spouse becomes incapacitated. In bankruptcy proceedings, the department will encourage judges to allow same-sex married couples to file for bankruptcy jointly. The department will also urge judges to require inclusion of alimony in domestic support obligations exempted from bankruptcy discharge. These changes are significant both for the lives of thousands of gay and lesbian couples and for advancing acceptance of same-sex relationships on the nation’s long march toward greater equality. That is why it was so disappointing, given Mr. Holder’s announcement, that the White House is still hesitating to move forward with another important anti-discrimination measure: barring federal contractors from refusing to hire workers on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. President Obama’s failure to sign an executive order that would prohibit such discrimination when using taxpayer dollars is a black mark on his record. Meantime, Michael Sam, a defensive lineman from the University of Missouri football team, has provided further evidence of how things are changing. His brave declaration that he is gay in an interview with John Branch published in The Times on Monday would make him the first openly gay player in the National Football League if he is drafted this spring. Should that happen, it would be yet another gay rights breakthrough.",316,203,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/gay-rights-and-the-justice-department.html,2014-02-11,Gay Rights and the Justice Department
0,joe,nocera,40,article,"“What is stopping us from moving to this kind of technology?” asked a perplexed Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota. It was last Tuesday, and the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Klobuchar sits, was holding a hearing about the recent breaches of Target and Neiman Marcus in which the data from tens of millions of credit and debit cards were stolen. The technology Klobuchar had in mind is known as chip-and-PIN. The chip refers to a computer chip embedded in a credit or debit card that encrypts data and authenticates the card. The PIN refers to a personal identification number the customer has to use, which, in effect, authenticates the user. It is no big secret that, from a security standpoint, a chip-and-PIN system is far superior to the magnetic stripe that is the backbone of the credit and debit card systems in the United States. Criminal gangs in Eastern Europe have learned how to penetrate many computer systems of American retailers and “skim” credit card data at the moment a transaction takes place. That kind of theft would be virtually impossible with a chip-and-PIN system. Nor is it news that much of the rest of the world long ago adopted chip-and-PIN technology; according to MasterCard, 79 percent of terminals in Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean are “chip-enabled,” a figure that rises to 95 percent in parts of Europe. But, inexplicably, this clearly superior technology has not yet penetrated the United States. Or maybe it’s not so inexplicable. The main stumbling block, it would appear, is that retailers and bankers have spent way too much time blaming each other for the growing data theft problem — and not nearly enough time worrying about the people whose data have been stolen. Namely, us. “Why did the U.S. stick with the mag stripe?” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report. It may not have been best for consumers, but it was “cheap and efficient” for the banks and retailers. What’s more, banks and retailers had a certain amount of fraud built into their business models. Thus, while a hacked card brought big headaches to the customer, it was just another cost of doing business for the other entities involved in the transaction. Even as Europe and Canada were moving to a chip-and-PIN system, the American banks held back. Fraud at the point of sale dropped dramatically in countries with chip-and-PIN. Still the U.S. held back. Every time there was a push to adopt chip-and-PIN, both retailers and bankers would do the math and come to the same conclusion: It wasn’t worth the trouble. And when a company did try to adopt it? That’s what Target tried to do around 2003 — only to discover that it was largely a waste of money if nobody else went along. In Europe and elsewhere governments had pushed companies to adopt chip-and-PIN. In the U.S., the banks and retailers needed to be able to work together — spending billions both to manufacture new cards and install new terminals that could read the cards. There are two things that are likely to change the equation. The first is the Target breach, which, one expert told me, could involve as many as one in every 10 cards in circulation in the United States. Many of the cards are debit cards, which means if the card is used by a crook to make a purchase, it comes directly out of the customer’s bank account. (Target has vowed to indemnify any customer who has losses as a result of the breach.) The Target breach has shown the reputational hit a company can take when its system is breached. It also has had business consequences: the last two weeks of the Christmas season were lousy ones for Target — and the publicity from the breach is considered a prime culprit. Second, though, Visa and MasterCard have both set forth timetables that attempt to institute the adoption of embedded-chips technology by the fall of 2015. Although the timetables are not mandatory, they would essentially shift the liability for card losses on to whichever side — the bank or the retailer — has the least secure technology. Although there were various calls for delaying the implementation yet again, those calls stopped once the Target breach took place. Which is not to say that the banks and the retailers are now seeing eye to eye. When I spoke to a bank lobbyist last week, he told me that the real problem was “a weakness in the internal computer system of large companies that sophisticated criminals have learned to exploit.” The retailers, meanwhile, retort that the banks have continually come up with ideas short of chip-and-PIN, none of which ever worked for long before the bad guys figured how to breach them. The only thing missing from these arguments is the consumer.",36,83,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/nocera-dogged-by-data-theft.html,2014-02-11,Dogged by Data Theft
0,david,brooks,786,article,"When foreign visitors used to describe American culture, they generally settled on different versions of one trait: energy. Whether driven by crass motivations or spiritual ones, Americans, visitors agreed, worked more frantically, moved more and switched jobs more than just about anybody else on earth. That’s changing. In the past 60 years, for example, Americans have become steadily less mobile. In 1950, 20 percent of Americans moved in a given year. Now, it’s around 12 percent. In the 1950s and 1960s, people lived in the same house for an average of five years; now people live in the same house for an average of 8.6 years. When it comes to geographic mobility, we are now at historic lows, no more mobile than people in Denmark or Finland. Why is this happening? A few theories offer partial explanations, but only partial ones. It is true that we are an aging nation and older people tend to move less. But today’s young people are much less mobile than young people from earlier generations. Between the 1980s and the 2000s alone, mobility among young adults dropped by 41 percent. It’s also true that many people are locked into homes with underwater values. But as Timothy Noah pointed out in Washington Monthly, mobility among renters is down just as sharply as mobility among homeowners. It’s also true that labor markets are getting more homogeneous. It used to be that the jobs found in Pittsburgh were different than the ones found in Atlanta. But now they are more similar, so there is less reason to move from one city to another. But that also fails to explain the tremendous drops over decades. No, a big factor here is a loss in self-confidence. It takes faith to move. You are putting yourself through temporary expense and hardship because you have faith that over the long run you will slingshot forward. Many highly educated people, who are still moving in high numbers, have that long-term faith. Less-educated people often do not. One of the oddities of the mobility that does exist is that people are not moving to low-unemployment/high-income areas. Instead they are moving to lower-income areas with cheap housing. That is to say, they are less likely to endure temporary housing hardship for the sake of future opportunity. They are more likely to move to places that offer immediate comfort even if the long-term income prospects are lower. This loss of faith is evident in other areas of life. Fertility rates, a good marker of confidence, are down. Even accounting for cyclical changes, people are less likely to voluntarily vacate a job in search of a better one. Only 46 percent of white Americans believe they have a good chance of improving their standard of living, the lowest levels in the history of the General Social Survey. Peter Beinart wrote a fascinating piece for National Journal, arguing that Americans used to have much more faith in capitalism, a classless society, America’s role in the world and organized religion than people from Europe. But now American attitudes resemble European attitudes, and when you just look at young people, American exceptionalism is basically gone. Fifty percent of Americans over 65 believe America stands above all others as the greatest nation on earth. Only 27 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 believe that. As late as 2003, Americans were more likely than Italians, Brits and Germans to say the “free market economy is the best system on which to base the future of the world.” By 2010, they were slightly less likely than those Europeans to embrace capitalism. Thirty years ago, a vast majority of Americans identified as members of the middle class. But since 1988, the percentage of Americans who call themselves members of the “have-nots” has doubled. Today’s young people are more likely to believe success is a matter of luck, not effort, than earlier generations. These pessimistic views bring to mind a concept that’s been floating around Europe: the Precariat. According to the British academic Guy Standing, the Precariat is the growing class of people living with short-term and part-time work with precarious living standards and “without a narrative of occupational development.” They live with multiple forms of insecurity and are liable to join protest movements across the political spectrum. The American Precariat seems more hunkered down, insecure, risk averse, relying on friends and family but without faith in American possibilities. This fatalism is historically uncharacteristic of America. No one response is going to reverse the trend, but Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute believes government should offer moving vouchers to the long-term unemployed so they can chase opportunity. If we could induce more people to Go West! (or South, East or North) in search of opportunity, maybe the old future-oriented mind-set would return.",433,584,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/brooks-the-american-precariat.html,2014-02-11,The American Precariat
0,danny,postel,350,article,"DENVER — THE Syrian people are starving. According to the United Nations, about 800,000 civilians are currently under siege. In areas around the cities of Homs, Aleppo and Deir Ezzor and in parts of the capital, Damascus, no food, medical supplies or humanitarian aid can get in, and people can’t get out. Many have already died under these “starvation sieges” and hundreds of thousands teeter on the brink, subsisting on grass and weeds. In Damascus, a cleric has ruled that under these conditions, Muslims are permitted to eat normally forbidden animals like cats, dogs and donkeys. This is not a famine. Food is abundant just a few miles away from these besieged areas. Military forces — mainly the army of President Bashar al-Assad, but in some cases extremist anti-Assad militias — are preventing food and medicine from reaching trapped civilians. In addition to starving, many people in besieged areas have been stricken by diseases, including polio, but can’t get medical treatment because doctors can’t get through. This moral obscenity demands action by the international community. Any armed group that prevents humanitarian access — whether the Syrian regime’s forces or rebel militias — should be subject to coercive measures. France’s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, has denounced the international community’s failure to prevent starvation as “absolutely scandalous” and is now calling for “much stronger action.” The news that France may propose a strong Security Council resolution is welcome, but Mr. Fabius hasn’t made clear whether such a measure would invoke Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which allows the Security Council to enforce its directives through military action. If it doesn’t, the resolution will be inadequate. The recent attacks on the convoys attempting to deliver humanitarian aid into the besieged city of Homs are a case in point: The lifting of the sieges can’t be left to the warring factions on the ground. An external, international force must be introduced to guarantee the safe passage of food and medicine to starving Syrian civilians. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, remains a major obstacle. His government has vetoed three Security Council resolutions on Syria since October 2011 and Russia has said it would support measures on humanitarian issues only if Syria agrees to them. But Mr. Putin’s geostrategic calculations and Mr. Assad’s coldblooded recalcitrance cannot be allowed to stand in the way of thousands of Syrian civilians eating. If Russia blocks meaningful international action, and if the Assad regime or any rebel group refuses to allow humanitarian aid into the besieged areas, the sieges must be broken by any means necessary. We should invoke the Responsibility to Protect, the principle that if a state fails to protect its populations from mass atrocities — or is in fact the perpetrator of such crimes — the international community must step in to protect the victims, with the collective use of force authorized by the Security Council. And if a multinational force cannot be assembled, then at least some countries should step up and organize Syria’s democratically oriented rebel groups to provide the necessary force on the ground, with air cover from participating nations. There are precedents to follow. The American-led and United Nations-approved multinational effort in Somalia between December 1992 and May 1993 was authorized to use “all necessary measures” to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid. In retrospect, this all-but-forgotten operation was largely successful in humanitarian terms. While public attention has focused on the “Black Hawk Down” battle of October 1993, a military failure, the strictly humanitarian goal of getting food to starving Somalis was in fact a success. Before any such operation begins, however, Mr. Assad and the rebel groups should be put on notice that they have 48 hours to lift the sieges. There are reasons to believe that the mere threat of coercive action would produce results. As we saw in September, the threat of force pushed the Assad regime to comply. Faced with President Obama’s threat of an imminent military strike last August, Mr. Assad, under Russian pressure, agreed to hand over his stockpile of chemical weapons (the same weapons he claimed he didn’t have). A similar threat of force could once again compel both Mr. Assad’s government and extremist rebels to make a choice: Allow humanitarian aid to flow or be subject to attack. Invoking the responsibility to protect would also confront Russia with a choice: Convince Mr. Assad to lift the sieges or be left behind by an international community that is prepared to act. Humanitarian interventions typically occur when moral principles overlap with political interests. As we approach the third anniversary of the Syrian conflict, this alignment is taking shape. Growing global outrage over the humanitarian nightmare in Syria — replete with refugee flows, sarin gas, barrel bombs, and “industrial-scale” killings and torture, as revealed last month in a collection of 55,000 gut-wrenching photographs — has horrified the world. Using force to prevent starvation will not immediately resolve the crisis in Syria. It will, however, make a qualitative difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians. It will also send a clear message to the Syrian regime and the extremist militias: The international community, after three years of watching this moral and humanitarian catastrophe unfold from the sidelines, is finally prepared to act.",746,635,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/use-force-to-save-starving-syrians.html,2014-02-11,Use Force to Save Starving Syrians
0,frank,bruni,6415,article,"A news flash for every straight man out there: You’ve been naked in front of a gay man. In fact you’ve been naked, over the course of your life, in front of many gay men, at least if you have more than a few years on you. And here you are — uninjured, uncorrupted, intact. The earth still spins. The sun rises and sets. Maybe it was in gym class, long ago. Maybe at the health club more recently. Or maybe when you played sports at the high school level, the college level, later on. Whether we gay guys are one in 10 or one in 25, it’s a matter of chance: At some point, one of us was within eyeshot when you stripped down. And you know what? He probably wasn’t checking you out. He certainly wasn’t beaming special gay-conversion gamma rays at you. That’s why you weren’t aware of his presence and didn’t immediately go out and buy a more expensive moisturizer and a disc of Judy Garland’s greatest hits. His purpose mirrored yours. He was changing clothes and showering. It’s a locker room, for heaven’s sake. Not last call at the Rawhide. On Sunday evening, in a story in The Times by John Branch and on ESPN, a college football star named Michael Sam came out. Because Sam is almost certain to be drafted, he could soon be the first openly gay active player in the National Football League — in any of the four major professional sports in the United States. Most reactions from the sports world were hugely positive, even inspirational. Some were not. “It’d chemically imbalance an N.F.L. locker room,” an N.F.L. personnel assistant, speaking anonymously, said to Sports Illustrated. I think steroids, Adderall and painkillers have already done a pretty thorough job of that, and on the evidence of his comment, they’ve addled minds in the process. Sports Illustrated quoted an unnamed assistant coach who also brought up the fabled sanctum of Tinactin and testosterone. “There’s nothing more sensitive than the heartbeat of the locker room,” he said. “If you knowingly bring someone in there with that sexual orientation, how are the other guys going to deal with it?” To his question, a few of my own: When did the locker room become such a delicate ecosystem? Is it inhabited by athletes or orchids? And how is it that gladiators who don’t flinch when a 300-pound mountain of flesh in shoulder pads comes roaring toward them start to quiver at the thought of a homosexual under a nearby nozzle? They may be physical giants, but at least a few of them are psychological pipsqueaks. And they’re surprisingly blunt and Paleolithic. When NFL Network’s Andrea Kremer recently brought up the possibility of an openly gay player with Jonathan Vilma, a New Orleans Saints linebacker, he said: “Imagine if he’s the guy next to me and, you know, I get dressed, naked, taking a shower, the whole nine, and it just so happens he looks at me.” “How am I supposed to respond?” Vilma added. Well, a squeal would be unmanly, Mace might not be enough and N.F.L. players tend to use their firearms away from the stadium, so I’d advise him to do what countless females of our species have done with leering males through history. Step away. Move on. Dare I say woman up? Or Vilma could use a line suggested by the sports journalist Cyd Zeigler on the website Outsports.com: “I’m so telling your boyfriend you stole a peek.” The anxiety about the locker room makes no sense in terms of the kind of chaotic setting it often is, with all sorts of people rushing through, including reporters of both sexes. It’s a workplace, really, and more bedlam than boudoir. The anxiety depends on stereotypes of gay men as creatures of preternatural libido. (Thanks, but I lunge faster for pasta than for porn.) And it’s illogical. “Every player knows that they are playing or have played with gay guys,” John Amaechi, a former pro basketball player who came out after his retirement, told me. It’s just that those gay guys didn’t or haven’t identified themselves. Why would doing so make them a greater threat? Wouldn’t an openly gay athlete have a special investment in proving that there’s zero to worry about? Michael Sam proved as much at the University of Missouri, where teammates learned of his sexual orientation before their most recent season. They finished 12-2, and are publicly praising him so far. Nothing about trembling or cowering in the showers. The person who raises that fear, Amaechi said, “is a bigot finally falling over the cliff and grasping for any straw that might keep their purchase. When every rational argument is gone, you go with that.”",16535,5066,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/bruni-panic-in-the-locker-room.html,2014-02-11,Panic in the Locker Room!
0,manal,al-sharif,144,article,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates —  In an incident that has reverberated throughout Saudi Arabia, two brothers, Saud and Nasser al-Qaws, aged 22 and 24, died last fall after their car was forced off a Riyadh bridge by members of Saudi Arabia’s religious police. The officers, members of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, allegedly objected to the patriotic songs the brothers were playing on the car stereo. They pursued the men at high speed, ramming their car three times before finally pushing it off the bridge. One of the young men was killed immediately; his brother died shortly thereafter. Cellphone footage of the incident in September, captured by a passerby and posted online, caused a public outcry. Attempting to mitigate the fallout, Sheikh Abdul Latif bin Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, head of the religious police, went on a public relations offensive. “The truth is that the pursuit took place,” he told Al Arabiya TV. He condemned the incident and said an investigation was underway. Long considered one of the country’s taboo subjects (along with any criticism of King Abdullah), the commission, also known as the mutaween, is now one of Saudi Arabia’s most controversial issues. Tapped to lead the force in 2012, Mr. Sheikh today finds himself facing both scathing public attacks and worsening internal conflict. The government, for its part, is wary of clamping down on the mutaween for fear of inciting a conservative backlash and is walking a fine line between the religious police and an increasingly angry populace. While dismantling of the force is unrealistic, this delicate moment opens a window of opportunity for Saudis. By continuing to voice anger and disapproval, the public may provide Riyadh with the leverage it needs to demand police adherence to regulations already in place, and slowly weaken the commission’s influence. The commission was formed in 1940 to enforce the implementation of Shariah, or Islamic law. It began its rise to prominence in 1979, after religious fanatics seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, denounced the royal family and called for new leadership. In the aftermath of the bloody two-week siege, Saudi clerics were given plenty of funding and a free hand to regulate morality. Today some 4,000 members of the mutaween patrol the streets, enforcing dress codes, the strict separation of men and women, the observance of daily prayers and other behavior that it considers to fall under the purview of Islam. Women, for example, are forbidden to drive. Although the force was initially embraced by Saudis, who are still predominantly religious and conservative, a series of incidents has increasingly soured public attitudes toward it. In 2002 in Mecca, 15 girls died in a school fire, prevented from fleeing by mutaween who claimed the students were inappropriately covered. In 2007, a dozen mutaween entered a Riyadh family’s home and fatally beat a 28-year-old man whom they suspected of illegally possessing alcohol. The man’s death outraged Saudis, and a lawsuit was brought, one of the first instances of legal action against the force. The charges were subsequently dropped, but the suit helped open the door to criticism, including by the press. Today, Saudi opinion of the commission is at an all-time low. Resentment grew last year when King Abdullah increased the force’s budget to $390 million. The spread of smartphones has made it easier to disseminate evidence of police overreach, and it is now more difficult for the force to sweep accusations under the carpet. Despite this, the fact that most cases brought against the commission still end in acquittals or dropped charges has done little to endear the religious police to Saudis. Now, internal fault lines seem to be widening as well. Mr. Sheikh is increasingly coming under attack by the force’s more conservative members for being too liberal and too Westernized. Shortly after taking over in 2012, Mr. Sheikh spearheaded a series of reforms aimed at bringing the mutaween in line. Volunteers were no longer allowed to join mutaween patrols; the confiscation of phones and other personal belongings was forbidden; workshops were introduced to teach mutaween how to deal with the public; the police could no longer receive funds from private businesses. Chief among Mr. Sheikh’s reforms was a ban on car chases — but the incident last September made it painfully clear that his orders were being ignored. In a controversial October interview with Rotana, a Saudi TV channel, Mr. Sheikh admitted that one of his most trusted confidants had recorded their conversations for use against him. The interview appeared soon after reports surfaced in the press of an attempt to murder Mr. Sheikh in a hit-and-run, allegedly ordered by the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Sheikh may not be able to rein in the mutaween, but there are signs that social media may be helping to counter the commission’s repressive regime. Saudis have thwarted several attempts to restrict phone and Internet use over the years, including a 2004 ban on camera phones (still forbidden in areas reserved for women only). The country’s current smartphone use is the third highest in the world. Despite strict regulations on Internet activity, Saudis are among the largest adopters of Twitter in the Arab world; 4.9 million Saudis were on Facebook as of early 2012. Last October, a woman in Qassim, considered Saudi Arabia’s most conservative region, lashed out at a member of the religious police who demanded that she cover her entire face (she was wearing a veil that left her eyes exposed). “Don’t provoke me!” the woman retorted. “Do you think we don’t know our own religion? We know our religion, and covered up before you even existed. The full facial cover is not forced upon a woman!” A 42-second video of her response blew up on Saudi social media. Using the hashtag #Don’tProvoke, people tweeted messages of support, criticizing the officer for berating a modestly dressed woman, and for doing so in front of her children. The public outpouring was a rarity in a country where, when it comes to confrontations between men and women, it is generally accepted that women are to blame. Her response highlighted the perception that the commission is an intrusive body that seeks to impose a narrow vision of religion on Saudi women. Equally noteworthy was her rejection of the officer’s definition of appropriate veiling practice. After years of relying on the teachings of a single religious authority, the websites and social networks the mutaween have fought so hard to repress have facilitated the spread of alternative views. A nearly 75-year-old police force can’t be disempowered overnight, and those like Mr. Sheikh who attempt to liberalize it risk fomenting a dangerous backlash. But, aided by social media, the doctrinal foundations of the religious establishment are finally beginning to crack. A broad-based, grass-roots show of anger against the mutaween may be the push the government needs to finally weaken and perhaps eventually dismantle the religious police.

But Kerry was only repeating what Israel’s own finance minister, Yair Lapid, had already said: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (B.D.S.) movement is beginning to bite. I am a strong supporter of a two-state peace. The messianic idea of Greater Israel, occupying all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, must wither. Jews, having suffered for most of their history as a minority, cannot, as a majority now in their state, keep their boots on the heads of the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank any longer. Palestinians must accept the permanence of the state of Israel within the 1967 lines with equitable land swaps. Competitive victimhood should cede to collaborative viability for the nation states of the Jewish and Palestinian peoples. Narratives and revealed truth do not a future make. They perpetuate the imprisoning past. So, in theory, B.D.S. might be a positive factor. When the largest Dutch pension fund and the largest Danish bank withdraw investments from, or cease business with, Israeli banks because of their operations in the settlements, they send a powerful signal to Israel to get out of the West Bank. Yet these developments make me uneasy for a simple reason: I do not trust the B.D.S. movement. Its stated aim is to end the occupation, secure “full equality” for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and fight for the right of return of all Palestinian refugees. The first objective is essential to Israel’s future. The second is laudable. The third, combined with the second, equals the end of Israel as a Jewish state. This is the hidden agenda of B.D.S., its unacceptable subterfuge: beguile, disguise and suffocate. The anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa contained no such ambiguity. As Diana Shaw Clark, an activist on behalf of a two-state solution, wrote to me in an email, “People affiliated with divestment in South Africa had no agenda other than the liberation and enfranchisement of an oppressed majority.” This is not the case in Israel, where the triple objective of B.D.S. would, in Clark’s words, “doom Israel as a national home for the Jews.” Mellifluous talk of democracy and rights and justice masks the B.D.S. objective that is nothing other than the end of the Jewish state for which the United Nations gave an unambiguous mandate in 1947. The movement’s anti-Zionism can easily be a cover for anti-Semitism. It would be gratifying if Israelis and Palestinians could learn overnight to live together as equal citizens in some United States of the Holy Land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, a binational and democratic secular state that resolves their differences. But it is an illusion to think this could ever happen, the one-state pipe dream. The fault lines are too deep. A single state cannot mark its Day of Independence and Day of Catastrophe on the same date. One state, however conceived, equals the end of Israel as a Jewish state, the core of the Zionist idea. Jews must not allow this to happen. Trust your neighbor? Been there, tried that. The so-called right of return of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians driven out in the 1948 war (whose descendants now number in the millions) cannot be exercised, any more than the Jews of Baghdad and Cairo have deeds to return home. There can, and should be, agreed compensation for the dispossessed, but there cannot be a reversal of history. The “right” is in fact a claim. A Jewish national home is needed. History demonstrated that. It must now be reinvented. For that, the corrosive occupation has to end and with it the settlement industry. B.D.S. is a wake-up call. I oppose it because I do not trust it. That does not mean, as Lapid intimated, that Israel can ignore its message. Israel can only be a state of laws again when the lawless enterprise beyond the Green Line ends. West of that line, Israel is a democracy affording greater minority rights than other regional states (Omar Barghouti, a B.D.S. leader, has a master’s degree from Tel Aviv University). But that is not enough. All citizens should enjoy equality in the Jews’ national home, a state where civil marriage becomes possible, state and synagogue are divorced, and Israelis are permitted to identify themselves as Israelis if they so wish, rather than as Jews or Arabs or Druze — that is as undifferentiated citizens.",726,610,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/opinion/cohen-the-bds-threat.html,2014-02-11,The B.D.S.

0,beppe,severgnini,110,article,"The world loves all things Italian, but the same cannot always be said of Italians themselves. Luigi Barzini Jr.’s book “The Italians” was read by millions around the world, but by few in Italy. Tourists flock to the Cortona countryside in Tuscany, but Italians could take it or leave it. Former Prime Minister Mario Monti was hailed outside Italy as our euro-crisis savior, but we Italians were less impressed. The same thing is happening to the director Paolo Sorrentino’s new film, “The Great Beauty,” which won the Golden Globe for best foreign-language film and is considered a front-runner for the Oscar in the same category. The world loves it; Italy, not so much — a fact that says a lot about how the world sees my country, but even more about how my country views itself. “The Great Beauty” tells the curious tale of 65-year-old, Naples-born, Rome-based Jep Gambardella, a journalist who specializes in cynicism, small talk and all-night partying around the Italian capital. It is full of lush urban landscapes and scandals amid the ruins; critics have praised it as a beautifully melancholic sweep of Italian history and national character. Italian critics, though, aren’t having it. It is pretentious, anachronistic and vapid, they say. The newspaper Il Foglio, comparing it unfavorably with “La Dolce Vita,” wrote that people assailed Federico Fellini’s film at first “because it was ahead of its time. This film lags behind, clinging onto the Sad ’70s.” My own newspaper, Corriere della Sera, said, “The over-affected literary dialogue ends up sounding verbose to the point of sententiousness.” I’ve seen the film — twice — and I have to say I’m with the non-Italians. But I’m also interested in why my country is getting so worked up about it. It’s true, as the ancient Romans said, that no man is a prophet in his own country. And that’s precisely what is happening here. “The Great Beauty” rubs many Italians the wrong way because it disturbs them, and is a hit with non-Italians because it fascinates them. For a start, it traces a paradoxical, but effective, sketch of a city that can digest anything, from popes to governments, pilgrims, tourists, artistic geniuses, social climbers, literary conceits and beautiful bodies. Rome is not Italy, but it is emblematic of Italy’s history, grandeur and perils. Mr. Sorrentino, who, like Jep Gambardella, is from Naples and who moved to the capital with his family a few years ago, renders all this intelligible with the frankness of an outsider. “The Great Beauty” is a portrait of a decadent, endearing city. Compassion laced with censure is too much for some Italians. Of course, “La Dolce Vita,” the 1960 film that directly inspired “The Great Beauty,” is also a film by a non-Roman, and it likewise depicts a decadent, endearing city. But Romans and other Italians liked it for one simple reason: Fellini depicted a Rome and an Italy on the way up. In contrast, Mr. Sorrentino describes a city and country going nowhere. Fellini’s Rome inspires indulgence and emotion; Sorrentino’s merely apprehension. Jep Gambardella, played by Toni Servillo, is a bizarre, acute observer of a city and country hiding their anxieties under a veneer of nonchalance. His characters are like the busts of famous, long-dead Italians that decorate Rome’s Pincian Hill: They remind us that all sorts of things have gone on in the city, but there may be no more history being made. Everything worth celebrating is in the past. It is this sensation of greatness veined with apprehension that many Italians find so unsettling. It whispers in our ear that Italy’s great beauty could become a great burden, an intimidating, consoling, reassuring, energy-sapping encumbrance. Remember that the nation with one of the world’s largest artistic heritages is also the only country in the euro zone where per capita gross domestic product has shrunk since the currency was introduced in 1999. Great beauty and a mediocre economy, but beauty won’t pay the rent. People abroad like “The Great Beauty” because it shows how behind every defect lies a virtue, and vice versa. But to do this, the film turns its spotlight on our defects, and it’s not nice to have a bright light shining in your face. Of course, New York, London, Tokyo and Beijing swarm with pseudo-intellectuals and talent-bereft artists, but in Italy, they’re more entertaining and take themselves less seriously. The Jep Gambardella lifestyle is unsuited to Stockholm or Zurich, where a 65-year-old man rolling home at daybreak would be greeted with disapproving looks, not a surprise around every corner and a 40-something woman in his bed. “The Great Beauty” appeals to non-Italians because its excitable, anxiety-ridden characters are familiar to all of us. “Italy is the land of human nature,” observed the American travel writer E.R.P. Vincent many years ago. Rome was, and still is, its capital city. Foreigners, drawn to the place yet leery of it, can sense this. They love Italy and fear it. Around the world, my country is seen as an emotional proving ground and a world congress for sensuality. The Italy of “The Great Beauty” is a great temptation. We are what others would like to be, at least some of the time — but don’t dare try.

0,marwan,bishara,20,article,"It seems so long since we hung out in Tahrir Square, where my Egyptian colleagues had concocted an archaic studio out of spotlights, stools and a few cameras, overlooking history in the making. They captured the highs and lows of the revolution from the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, to the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood and the election of President Mohamed Morsi, followed by their ouster by the military. The work of these Al Jazeera journalists was to be a first draft — or should I say, a rough cut — of the history of modern Egypt. With little sleep and less comfort, they contended with conditions that could not have been more miserable; yet they couldn’t have been happier. It was a reporter’s dream come true. Like Cairo’s traffic, the revolution was chaotic and unruly, but it was making steady progress. Then, last July 3, it came to an abrupt halt. The military took over. Revolutionary Egypt was forced into reverse; any obstacle in its way was crushed, including the most fragile of its victories, freedom of expression. In a leaked video aired by Al Jazeera, the general in charge, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, took a keen interest in journalism. “It takes a long time before you’re able to affect and control the media,” he said. “We are working on this and we are achieving more positive results, but we have yet to achieve what we want.” But what dictatorship wants to wait? The military shut down unfriendly news outlets and started a campaign of intimidating journalists, both Egyptian and foreign. The repression was so random that, according to The Economist, even a film crew that was working for a Washington public relations firm hired to improve the government’s image was arrested. Especially noxious treatment has been reserved for Al Jazeera. Egypt’s new rulers keep a close eye on the network because its channels are widely watched across Egypt and the rest of the world. They also claim that Al Jazeera, which is owned by the state of Qatar, is a mouthpiece for the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. This is a false characterization the network’s journalists do not accept. The Egyptian authorities have rounded up several of our colleagues at Al Jazeera Arabic, our Middle East service, confiscated their cameras and shut down our bureau. While all except one were released, arrest warrants were also issued for 20 people who, the government says, either currently work for Al Jazeera or have done so in the past, among them several foreigners. They include three journalists from Al Jazeera English, the English-language network that also includes Al Jazeera America, who were arrested in December: Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. They have now been charged with broadcasting false reports of unrest with the intention of helping the Muslim Brotherhood destabilize Egypt. This is merely propaganda to cover up censorship and repression. Mr. Greste, our award-winning foreign correspondent, wrote from his cold cell: “How do you accurately and fairly report on Egypt’s ongoing political struggle without talking to everyone involved?” It’s telling that in the same month as their arrests, three secular leaders of the 2011 revolution, including Ahmed Maher of the April 6 movement, were sentenced to three years in prison for involvement in an unauthorized protest. There was a pro-government rally on the same day that also was not authorized; it did not prompt any arrests. In a country that is terribly polarized and dangerously tense, one Egyptian’s hard news is another’s false report. The government and its lackeys portray journalists and critics as spies and traitors, using baseless innuendo: They refer to our unfairly detained colleagues as the “Marriott Cell,” for the hotel in which they were arrested. Attacks on journalists in an attempt to suppress the freedom of the press are not unique to Egypt. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 211 reporters were in prison worldwide in 2013, and 232 in 2012, the two worst years on record. The International Federation of Journalists reported that 105 media workers were killed in 2013; that’s two every week. While extremist groups have been behind a good number of these injustices, in certain cases, governments — some allied with the United States — are culpable. Egypt is a case in point. Designated a “major non-NATO ally,” it is the second-largest recipient of American aid, economic and military combined. Since its 1979 peace treaty with Israel, Egypt has received $66 billion in cash and goods from the United States, including heavy-duty hardware like 1,000 tanks and 221 fighter jets. It’s puzzling, therefore, to hear America’s leverage with Egyptian leaders being minimized where human rights and freedom of expression are concerned. Over 500 Egyptian officers benefit from the American military education system annually, including the country’s chief of staff and seemingly its prospective president, General Sisi. The White House has expressed its deep concern, and the State Department called the detaining of my colleagues “egregious,” but in reality, Washington has been sending mixed messages to Egypt’s military-backed government. The Obama administration did announce it would withhold military equipment and $250 million in cash until Egypt’s military-backed government made progress on democracy and human rights. But then Congress passed a spending bill that would restore more than $1.5 billion in military and economic aid — in effect, flouting the law that prohibits doling out foreign aid to regimes that overthrow democratically elected governments. Less than five years ago, President Obama told Egyptians: “We will welcome all elected, peaceful governments — provided they govern with respect for all their people.” Obviously, Egypt’s military-backed government has failed on all three standards; it must be held to account. We want our colleagues freed; we want Egypt free. No country can be free when journalists linger in its prisons.

0,camelia,entekhabifard,109,article,"Last March, I sublet my Manhattan apartment. A woman called Shireen answered my ad, and when she came to visit I was surprised to learn that, despite her traditionally Persian name, she was Indian. Mentioning this, Shireen replied, “But I am Persian! I’m Zoroastrian.” In India, she explained, Zoroastrians are called Parsis (literally, “Persian”) in reference to their Persian ancestry. Zoroastrianism was Iran’s primary religion until the mid-seventh century, when Islam was imposed on the country by conquering Arabs. Many Zoroastrians fled to India to avoid forced conversion and discrimination. Today, Iran counts some 30,000 Zoroastrians; those who practice openly face persecution and are considered second-class citizens. Still, I urged Shireen to visit Iran and explore her heritage. But my encouragement was a painful reminder that I, born and raised in Iran, hadn’t been back in 14 years. After being arrested and jailed in 1999 for reporting critically on the government, I fled to write and work freely. I wasn’t certain I could visit anytime soon. Feb. 11 marks the 35th anniversary of the revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in power since 1941, and established an Islamic state. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the revolution and subsequently became Iran’s religious and political leader for life, promised justice, democracy and the rule of law. In an attempt to eliminate what he perceived as Western corruption, Ayatollah Khomeini mismanaged the economy, setting back development and  widening the gap between rich and poor — while  engaging in a devastating eight-year war with Iraq. The missteps continued under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who beat the anti-Western drum despite harsh sanctions that left many Iranians impoverished. In the 35 years since the revolution, millions of Iranians have emigrated. Some left seeking freedom of expression, others to escape religious persecution or even execution. Of the approximately 100,000 Jews in Iran at the time of the revolution, only 20,000 remain. They, like Shireen’s ancestors, no longer felt welcome in their homeland. Today, despite promises by the new president, Hassan Rouhani, to protect the freedom of ethnic and religious minorities (and the appointment of an aide to focus on their affairs), the persecution continues. Baha’is, the country’s largest non-Muslim religious minority, are widely referred to as infidels and prohibited from practicing openly; their children can not attend university. Still, a strong sense of nationhood endures. The Persian empire, which at its peak stretched from North Africa to Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, boasted a wide array of ethnicities and religions. While these groups maintained their individuality, they also became part of a greater whole. Like the beloved carpets replete with flowers, colors and patterns, Iran is a fabric of cultures and faiths woven to create a pluralistic society. The different ethnicities and religions are its flowers and colors; the carpet is beautiful because of their variety and distinctiveness. This deep sense of connection was not born overnight. And it cannot be destroyed in 35 years. Unlike in Lebanon, Pakistan or Afghanistan, sectarianism does not play a major role in Iran. Indeed, ethnic groups are so well-integrated that they include some of the nation’s most important figures. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the current supreme leader, is an ethnic Azeri. But this is neither protested nor trumpeted as an achievement. When Saddam Hussein attacked predominantly Shiite Iran in 1980, he believed that Arabs in southern Iran, who are mainly Sunni, would welcome his army onto Iranian soil. But this was a grave miscalculation. Instead they used their bodies to block Saddam’s troops — not necessarily to defend the ayatollah, but out of love for their country. Tehran’s decades-long pressure on Iranians to forget their pre-Islamic history and accomplishments has only generated increasing resentment. As the regime celebrates its 35th anniversary, I know that my people are preparing to fight back in March by celebrating Persian New Year, or Nowruz. The government strongly discourages Nowruz celebrations, given the holiday’s Zoroastrian roots. Still, last year, thousands of Iranians traveled to Shiraz, a southern city considered one of Persia’s oldest, and the nearby ancient site of Persepolis, to celebrate near the tomb of Cyrus the Great. Last month, a temporary international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program took effect. Many hope that this reflects a changed Iran: one that understands that it can’t endlessly antagonize the West, and is willing to make concessions. But real change will only come when the Islamic Republic extends concessions to its own people, welcoming all of them to live and practice what they believe. This is what our nation’s history tells us: A revolution can only reflect victory if it includes all people of Iranian heritage.

0,,,49,article,"Addressing the opening session late last month of the Munich Security Conference, a yearly gathering of top Western diplomats and defense officials, President Joachim Gauck of Germany expressed sentiments that not many years ago would have brought demonstrators into the streets. The Germans, he declared, should stop hiding behind guilt over their militaristic past and take more responsibility for shaping international affairs. If that meant using the Germany Army, “Germany should not say ‘no’ on principle.” This time there were no public protests, suggesting that Germany is now open to more public debate over whether there should be a larger German presence in helping resolve conflicts around the globe. Mr. Gauck’s basic argument was that Europe and NATO must assume a greater role in international affairs, and that Germany in particular must do more, as befits its status as Europe’s most populous and industrialized country. In recent years, Germany has begun to emerge from the deep pacifism that arose as a reaction to its crimes in World War II, sending troops to Afghanistan, Kosovo and elsewhere. Even so, many Germans remain profoundly reluctant to become more militarily active abroad. When the United Nations Security Council authorized aerial strikes in Libya in 2011, Germany abstained. Germany, moreover, spends less on its military — about 1.3 percent of G.D.P. — than Britain or France, a fact that is often criticized by both those countries and by the United States, especially as Germany is the world’s third-largest exporter of weapons, behind the United States and Russia. President Gauck is hardly the first German leader to challenge Germany’s military reticence. But the venue and timing of his comments — and his own history as an anti-Communist pastor in East Germany — ensured that his call would earn a wide audience. And he is not alone in urging more German involvement in global concerns. On the eve of the conference, Ursula von der Leyen, who was named Germany’s first female defense minister in December, declared in an interview that she was prepared to send more German troops into conflict zones. On the day before Mr. Gauck spoke, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, visited Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to ask for a greater German political and economic presence in the search for global stability. It was not clear whether Mr. Gauck’s speech had been cleared with Ms. Merkel. Even if not, the president has done a good turn by spurring a critical and timely debate. It was right for Germans to react against the militarism that possessed them 70 years ago, but, as Mr. Gauck argued, that guilt no longer gives Germans the right to look the other way when the West is called on to help people threatened by genocide, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity.",38,66,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/opinion/a-more-useful-germany.html,2014-02-10,A More Useful Germany
0,,,28,article,"For months, Israelis and Palestinians, with American mediation, have been working on a set of principles that would serve as the basis for negotiations on a final peace agreement. By the end of March, the world is likely to know whether they have been successful. If the two sides agree on basic principles — a framework for further talks — it will be an important step. But then comes the even tougher task of translating principles into a final deal that would recognize a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The principles that Secretary of State John Kerry has been working on are often seen as American ideas. But rather than being impossible demands imposed by Washington, they will reflect what the administration thinks is possible — its best judgment on where the two parties are on the major issues and what they might be able to agree to in a final deal. Even so, this does not guarantee acceptance; the political pressures on both sides are immense, especially within Israel. Some mostly predictable details have leaked out. The framework is expected to call for an end to the conflict and all claims, following a phased Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank (based on the 1967 lines), with unprecedented security arrangements in the strategic Jordan Valley. Israel will retain certain settlement blocs and the Palestinians will be compensated with Israeli territory; the American special envoy, Martin Indyk, has reportedly told Jewish leaders that up to 80 percent of the Jewish settlers will be annexed to Israel. There is less clarity on other core issues, including, crucially, the future of Jerusalem. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told The Times that as part of a peace agreement Israeli soldiers could remain in the West Bank for up to five years. He also promised that Palestine would be demilitarized, retaining only a police force, and invited a NATO force to stay there indefinitely. That Mr. Abbas has accepted Israel’s concern about security and appears willing to address it is a positive sign. American officials have also spoken of putting drones and sensors along the border. Mr. Kerry, to his credit, has been publicly forcing both sides to confront the consequences they face if the process fails. At recent international conferences, he has spoken about the stakes, including the potential for a new, more virulent cycle of violence; the potential loss of Israel’s identity as a democratic state; and the peril from a growing international boycott against Israel that could result in diplomatic isolation as well as economic losses. All of this has touched some very tender nerves in Israel, where some criticism of Mr. Kerry has been borderline outrageous. Naftali Bennett, the economy minister and far-right leader, has effectively accused him of anti-Semitism. Despite his three decades of support for Israel, Mr. Kerry has become a convenient scapegoat for those in Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government who, like Mr. Bennett, are fundamentally hostile to a peace deal. The prime minister could face the possibility of having to form a new coalition if he really wants to move forward. The framework is still a work in progress. There is a lot riding on Mr. Kerry’s ability to guide a process that will lead to negotiations on a final deal, presuming Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas have the courage to follow through.",150,81,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/opinion/closing-in-on-basic-mideast-principles.html,2014-02-10,Closing In on Basic Mideast Principles
0,,,44,article,"The constitutional provision that gives the president virtually unlimited authority to grant clemency was not an afterthought. The founders understood very well that there could be miscarriages of justice even under the rule of law. By allowing the president to commute unjust sentences or pardon deserving petitioners who had served their time, they sought to ensure that the workings of the courts could be tempered with mercy. Presidents Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Lincoln, and Truman viewed the clemency process as a central mission of the office. But the concept of mercy went out of fashion by the 1980s, when the country embarked on a mandatory sentencing craze that barred judges from exercising leniency when it was clearly warranted and placed the justice system almost entirely in the hands of prosecutors. As a consequence, even first-time offenders were largely viewed as beyond redemption. These laws drove up the prison population 10-fold and filled the jails with young, low-level drug offenders who were confined far longer than their offenses warranted. They also created a large and growing class of felons, who are trapped permanently at the margins of society by postprison sanctions — laws that bar them from jobs and housing, strip them of the right to vote and make it difficult for them to obtain essential documents like driver’s licenses. The perpetual punishment model of justice has had far-reaching consequences. Politicians stayed as far away from clemency as they could, fearing that voters would view them as soft on crime. Meanwhile, at the Justice Department, the clemency process — which had been a cabinet-level responsibility — fell under the authority of prosecutors who seemed to view even reasonable lenience as a threat to the prosecutorial order. The time required to handle clemency applications went from months to years; the backlog grew; the stream of mercy that had once flowed began to dry up. The clemency system, in other words, is in a state of collapse. The Justice Department admitted as much last month, when the deputy attorney general, James Cole, asked the criminal defense bar to help the department find suitable candidates for clemency among the many thousands of people who were casualties of the mandatory-sentencing era. Mr. Cole specifically mentioned nonviolent, low-level drug offenders who are serving “life or near-life” sentences that are considered excessive under current law. He was clearly referring to people prosecuted under the abjectly racist 1986 federal law that punished people caught with crack cocaine far more severely than those caught with the powdered form of the drug. In 2010, Congress reduced, but did not eliminate, the sentencing disparity, and thousands of people sentenced under the original law are still living behind bars. President Obama commuted the sentences of eight of them in December; even so, his has been one of the least merciful administrations in modern history. The Justice Department’s sudden interest in the clemency problem is good news, but asking defense lawyers for help is a haphazard approach. What’s needed is wholesale reform of the department’s pardon office, which has proved itself ineffective and incompetent, partly because the current process relies on the department to evaluate its own work. One sound idea is to create a clemency review panel outside the Justice Department, perhaps as a part of the executive office. Mr. Obama could form an advisory board, or reconfigure the pardon office to include defense lawyers, sociologists and other experts who would bring a broader perspective to the issue. The goal would be to give the president unbiased information that would enable him to exercise fully this important aspect of executive power.",669,412,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/opinion/mercy-in-the-justice-system.html,2014-02-10,Mercy in the Justice System
0,paul,krugman,1871,article,"Back in 1987 my Princeton colleague Alan Blinder published a very good book titled “Hard Heads, Soft Hearts.” It was, as you might guess, a call for tough-minded but compassionate economic policy. Unfortunately, what we actually got — especially, although not only, from Republicans — was the opposite. And it’s difficult to find a better example of the hardhearted, softheaded nature of today’s G.O.P. than what happened last week, as Senate Republicans once again used the filibuster to block aid to the long-term unemployed. What do we know about long-term unemployment in America? First, it’s still at near-record levels. Historically, the long-term unemployed — those out of work for 27 weeks or more — have usually been between 10 and 20 percent of total unemployment. Today the number is 35.8 percent. Yet extended unemployment benefits, which went into effect in 2008, have now been allowed to lapse. As a result, few of the long-term unemployed are receiving any kind of support. Second, if you think the typical long-term unemployed American is one of Those People — nonwhite, poorly educated, etc. — you’re wrong, according to research by the Urban Institute’s Josh Mitchell. Half of the long-term unemployed are non-Hispanic whites. College graduates are less likely to lose their jobs than workers with less education, but once they do they are actually a bit more likely than others to join the ranks of the long-term unemployed. And workers over 45 are especially likely to spend a long time unemployed. Third, in a weak job market long-term unemployment tends to be self-perpetuating, because employers in effect discriminate against the jobless. Many people have suspected that this was the case, and last year Rand Ghayad of Northeastern University provided a dramatic confirmation. He sent out thousands of fictitious résumés in response to job ads, and found that potential employers were drastically less likely to respond if the fictitious applicant had been out of work more than six months, even if he or she was better qualified than other applicants. What all of this suggests is that the long-term unemployed are mainly victims of circumstances — ordinary American workers who had the bad luck to lose their jobs (which can happen to anyone) at a time of extraordinary labor market weakness, with three times as many people seeking jobs as there are job openings. Once that happened, the very fact of their unemployment made it very hard to find a new job. So how can politicians justify cutting off modest financial aid to their unlucky fellow citizens? Some Republicans justified last week’s filibuster with the tired old argument that we can’t afford to increase the deficit. Actually, Democrats paired the benefits extension with measures to increase tax receipts. But in any case this is a bizarre objection at a time when federal deficits are not just falling, but clearly falling too fast, holding back economic recovery. For the most part, however, Republicans justify refusal to help the unemployed by asserting that we have so much long-term unemployment because people aren’t trying hard enough to find jobs, and that extended benefits are part of the reason for that lack of effort. People who say things like this — people like, for example, Senator Rand Paul — probably imagine that they’re being tough-minded and realistic. In fact, however, they’re peddling a fantasy at odds with all the evidence. For example: if unemployment is high because people are unwilling to work, reducing the supply of labor, why aren’t wages going up? But evidence has a well-known liberal bias. The more their economic doctrine fails — remember how the Fed’s actions were supposed to produce runaway inflation? — the more fiercely conservatives cling to that doctrine. More than five years after a financial crisis plunged the Western world into what looks increasingly like a quasi-permanent slump, making nonsense of free-market orthodoxy, it’s hard to find a leading Republican who has changed his or her mind on, well, anything. And this imperviousness to evidence goes along with a stunning lack of compassion. If you follow debates over unemployment, it’s striking how hard it is to find anyone on the Republican side even hinting at sympathy for the long-term jobless. Being unemployed is always presented as a choice, as something that only happens to losers who don’t really want to work. Indeed, one often gets the sense that contempt for the unemployed comes first, that the supposed justifications for tough policies are after-the-fact rationalizations. The result is that millions of Americans have in effect been written off — rejected by potential employers, abandoned by politicians whose fuzzy-mindedness is matched only by the hardness of their hearts.",3332,3014,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/opinion/krugman-writing-off-the-unemployed.html,2014-02-10,Writing Off the Unemployed
0,blain,roberts,1129,article,"FRESNO, Calif. — EVERY Saturday in late December and January, as reports of brutal temperatures and historic snowfalls streamed in from family in Vermont, New York and even southern Louisiana, we made weekly pilgrimages to our local beer garden to enjoy craft brews and unseasonably warm afternoons. Normal winters here in Fresno, in the heart of California’s Central Valley, bring average highs in the 50s, steady periods of rain and drizzle, and the dense, bone-chilling Tule fog that can blanket the valley for days and even weeks on end. But not this year. Instead, early 2014 gave us cloudless skies and midday temperatures in the 70s. By the end of January, it seemed like April, with spring trees in full bloom. We fretted over the anomalous weather, to be sure. A high-pressure system parked off the Alaskan coast had produced not just our high temperatures but also soaring levels of fine particulate matter in the air and more than 50 rainless days, worsening a three-year drought, the most severe in half a millennium. If it’s this bad in January, we wondered, what’s it going to be like in July? But then we’d return to the beer taps, or meander over to peruse food truck menus. Life in the Central Valley revolves around two intricately related concerns: the quality of the air and the quantity of the water. Although Fresno is the state’s fifth-largest city, it is really just a sprawling farm town in the middle of the nation’s most productive agricultural region, often called “America’s fruit basket.” Surrounded by mountains, which trap the pollution created by a surging population, interstate transportation and tens of thousands of farms, the valley has noxious air, even on good days. The political atmosphere surrounding crop irrigation is equally toxic. Some farms in the western Valley — crippled by cuts in water allocations, salt buildup in the soil and depleted aquifers — now resemble the dust bowl that drove so many Tom Joads here in the 1930s. Farmers line highways with signs insisting that “food grows where water flows,” while environmentalists counter that the agriculture industry consumes 75 percent of the water transported by California’s byzantine water system. Locals assess the situation in numbers and colors. Meteorologists compile and trade rainfall statistics with all the regularity and precision of batting averages, but without any of the fun. The air quality index — ranging from a “healthy” green to a “hazardous” maroon — occupies an ominous presence in the day, not unlike the color-coded terrorism alert scale adopted after 9/11. Experts offer dire warnings. The current drought has already eclipsed previous water crises, like the one in 1977, which a meteorologist friend, translating into language we understand as historians, likened to the “Great Depression” of droughts. Most Californians depend on the Sierra Nevada for their water supply, but the snowpack there was just 15 percent of normal in early February. And the dry conditions are likely to make the polluted air in the Central Valley — which contributes to high rates of asthma and the spread of Valley Fever, a potentially fatal airborne fungus — even worse. The current crisis raises the obvious question: How long can we continue to grow a third of the nation’s fruit and vegetables? Tom Willey — an organic farmer from nearby Madera with the genial manner and snowy beard of a Golden State Santa Claus — certainly wonders. For six and a half years, he and his wife, Denesse, have provided most of our family’s fresh produce through their community-supported agriculture program. The Willeys taught us to appreciate kohlrabi and even turned our 5-year-old into a fan of brussels sprouts, which she likes to eat straight from the farm box. Twenty years ago, the water table under the Willeys’ farm measured 120 feet. But a well test in late January revealed that it is now 60 feet lower. Half of that decline, Tom estimates, has occurred in the last two years. The Willeys have done what they can to cope. They’ve cut back on less profitable crops, and they are already dedicated practitioners of sustainable agriculture. But many farmers aren’t, and the future is worrisome. Pumping from aquifers is so intense that the ground in parts of the valley is sinking about a foot a year. Once aquifers compress, they can never fill with water again. It’s no surprise Tom Willey wakes every morning with a lump in his throat. When we ask which farmers will survive the summer, he responds quite simply: those who dig the deepest and pump the hardest. Yet for all the doom around us, here in Fresno itself it is hard to find evidence that the drought is changing the behavior of city dwellers. Locals have made a few concessions, though mainly to mitigate the effects of the bad air. The two of us, for instance, have skipped afternoon jogs to ease the strain on our lungs. And while religious communities around the valley organized a day of prayer and fasting, entreating God to send rain, concrete efforts to solve the water problem are less apparent. Gov. Jerry Brown has called on all Californians to reduce their water use by 20 percent, but residential lawns, seeded each year with winter ryegrass, continue to glow in brilliant, bright-green hues, kept alive by sprinkler systems that are activated in the dark of night. Fresnans have long resisted water-saving measures, clinging tenaciously to a flat rate, all-you-can-use system. Nudged by state and federal officials, Fresno began outfitting new homes with water meters in the early 1990s, but voters passed a ballot initiative prohibiting the city from actually reading them. It took two decades for all area homes to acquire meters and for the city to start monitoring the units. To its credit, Fresno has a watering schedule, limiting when residents can water their lawns. But enforcement, to put it charitably, is lax. Our behavior here in the valley feels untenable and self-destructive, and for much of it we are to blame. But we also find support among an enthusiastic group of enablers: tens of millions of American shoppers who devour the lettuce and raisins, carrots and tomatoes, almonds and pistachios grown in our fields. Rain showers moved in Thursday morning, for the third time in a week. The faithful will see signs of divine intervention, but it seems clear we need to stage one of our own. These storms brought less than two inches of rain — merely a drop in our tired, leaky bucket.",1904,1457,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/opinion/the-dust-bowl-returns.html,2014-02-10,The Dust Bowl Returns
0,murong,xuecun,184,article,"BEIJING —  Iron Palm Du Dapeng’s eyes are burning with rage. The Chinese martial arts expert strikes a Japanese soldier with his fist and then, using his supernatural powers, tears the soldier in half. Blood splatters, but not a drop lands on the kung fu master. This is one of many violent scenes in the Chinese television series “The Anti-Japanese Knight,” a recent action drama set during the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s. Like many Chinese television dramas, the “Anti-Japanese Knight” promotes patriotism and praises the Communist Party for defeating the Japanese, while conveniently leaving out mention of the decisive role played by the Chinese Nationalists in that war. The violence and anti-Japanese tone send a clear message that killing is acceptable — as long as the targets are “Japanese devils.” I have little doubt that many Chinese people take the “Anti-Japanese Knight” and its version of history as fact, just as I used to think that China won the second Sino-Japanese War by digging tunnels in villages and planting homemade land mines, thanks to “Tunnel Warfare” and “Landmine Warfare,” two classic Chinese-made war movies from the 1960s. Before television arrived in the countryside, film teams took projectors to villages to screen movies; they were often shown outdoors. As a child in the 1970s, I’d go to screenings as often as possible, blissfully unaware that most of what I was watching was Communist Party propaganda. I must have watched “Tunnel Warfare” and “Landmine Warfare” at least a dozen times. When I turn on the television these days, I notice not much has changed. The second Sino-Japanese War may have ended in 1945, but the Chinese people are still haunted by it. Enemy Japanese soldiers run amok on Chinese screens. The state-approved films and TV dramas of today are more colorful and the actors are better-looking than in the films of 1960s and ’70s, but the themes remain the same. The state prohibits content that “incites ethnic hatred,” yet according to Southern Weekly more than 70 anti-Japanese TV series were screened in China in 2012. And in March 2013 the newspaper reported that 48 anti-Japanese-themed TV series were being shot simultaneously in Hengdian World Studios, a film studio in Zhejiang Province, in eastern China. The result of this stream of rancor is just what you’d expect. A July 2013 Pew research report found that 90 percent of Chinese people have an unfavorable view of Japan. And the hatred for Japan is intensifying. Pew said that “favorability” for Japan has fallen 17 percentage points since 2006. The anti-Japan virulence drummed up by the media is in full display online. Websites popular among young Chinese nationalists, like Tiexue (Iron Blood) and April Media, are riddled with slogans such as “Destroy Japanese dogs!” or “Annihilate the Japanese people!” The flow of hate comes while China is building up its military, leaving its neighbors on edge. Beijing will spend $148 billion on its military this year, up from $139 billion in 2013. It launched its first aircraft carrier in 2012, and is building a fleet of submarines that it hopes will outnumber the American fleet. A hard-line, anti-Western documentary film produced by the Chinese military called “Silent Contest,” circulated online in October 2013, revealed a troubling war-thirsty mind-set among the military. The video attempted to make the case that the United States is actively working to sabotage the Chinese government. Whoever leaked this video may not represent mainstream military thinking, but there is no doubt that pro-military voices are growing louder. Meanwhile, Beijing repeatedly criticizes Tokyo’s “militarism.” But what are China’s leaders thinking when they promote such hate of their neighbor? The world must be vigilant against “militarism” whenever it arises, but the Chinese government needs to review its own propaganda policies — and weigh the consequences of barraging citizens with such a negative view of Japan. For now, a small chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea is the focal point of contention between the China and Japan. In 2012, tensions over the islands triggered anti-Japanese riots in Chinese cities. Cai Yang, a 21-year-old construction worker in Xi’an, smashed the skull of Li Jianli, the owner of a Japanese car, with a bicycle lock. Mr. Cai’s mother, explaining the source of her son’s “patriotic” rage, couldn’t have been more trenchant with her question: “When we turn on the TV, most of the dramas are about anti-Japanese war. How would it be possible to not to hate Japanese?”

0,françois,heisbourg,15,article,"Paris —  François Hollande, the first French president to pay a state visit to the United States since 1996, is seemingly a man of paradox. Before the 2012 elections, he was taunted by political rivals as “flanby” (a custardlike dessert) or “capitaine de pédalo” (paddle boat captain) — hardly epithets befitting a would-be commander in chief. Yet, within his first 20 months in office, the Socialist Party’s successor to President Nicolas Sarkozy has ordered his country’s troops into two African conflicts, in Mali and the Central African Republic, and came within hours of unleashing cruise missiles against Syria. There is a certain irony, then, that this avowedly interventionist French president is meeting an American president who has been chiefly preoccupied with the task of disengaging his country from two wearying and costly military entanglements. How to reconcile the tension between their contrasting priorities will be high on the agenda this week for President Barack Obama and Mr. Hollande. It might be tempting to ascribe Mr. Hollande’s military decision making to political expediency, but this would be a serious misreading of why France goes to war. Presidents Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy were not shy of foreign intervention (in Bosnia and Kosovo, and in Afghanistan and Libya, respectively). Neither were their predecessors, François Mitterrand (in Lebanon and Chad) and Valéry Giscard d’Estaing (dubbed “l’Africain” for his propensity for military action in Africa). The outlier in this pattern was France’s refusal to participate in President George W. Bush’s misadventure in Iraq. While this may have imprinted on the American psyche a tabloid press impression of French membership in an “axis of weasel,” France’s robust opposition to the Iraq war has actually reinforced the French public’s trust in the executive’s judgment on matters of war and peace — in sharp contrast to popular attitudes in America and Britain, as we saw last August during the diplomatic crisis over Syria. None of this means that the French have turned into latter-day Prussians: Before Mr. Sarkozy intervened in Libya, barely one-third of the population supported military action. But once the campaign had begun, support jumped to 66 percent. Experienced politicians also know that even successful wars don’t win elections. Even after the good outcome of the operation he ordered against Islamist insurgents in Mali, Mr. Hollande remarked pointedly that military intervention wasn’t what the voters had chosen him for. Yet the performance of French forces in Libya and Mali has certainly bolstered the nation’s military self-confidence. France’s sense of having been vindicated in resisting American pressure over Iraq has also had the counterintuitive effect of making it easier now for the French to work with the United States in places and at times of their choosing. After the chemical weapons attacks in Syria last summer, the French even found themselves leading the charge for a military response, beyond what Mr. Obama was willing to countenance in the absence of congressional approval. Differences emerged anew on Nov. 10, when France initially blocked a nuclear deal with Iran. The White House invitation to Mr. Hollande, issued on Nov. 22, could be seen as recognition that America needed to work harder to keep its ally close. But Mr. Obama should expect the French to continue to press for a tough stance in dealing with the Iranian nuclear program. Conversely, France worries deeply — as do other European and Middle Eastern allies — about America’s foreign policy shift after Iraq and Afghanistan, its reluctance to put American forces in the front line in the world’s trouble spots. France also fears the long-term consequences of the Obama administration’s pivot to Asia. These concerns will certainly color Mr. Hollande’s visit, albeit in a constructive spirit rather than with traditional Gallic petulance. We can expect Mr. Hollande to stress the importance of maintaining close French-American military cooperation, whether in a region where the French are leading, like counterterrorism operations in the Sahara, or where the United States is the prime mover, like the Indian Ocean. On another front, France and Britain are building joint facilities to simulate nuclear tests in order to ensure the long-term effectiveness of their atomic stockpiles. This and the fact that Paris and London have cultivated a close military relationship help Mr. Obama: The White House is not being asked to referee a beauty contest between France and Britain. With no immediate large-scale crisis to contend with, and in the absence of major disagreements, each president should get what he wants from this visit. For Mr. Obama, that will be a demonstration that the United States is not losing allies and influence in Europe as a lower-profile America turns toward Asia. For Mr. Hollande, it will be an endorsement of the view that France, despite its economic problems, remains a major power that counts in the eyes of the world’s super power.

0,michael,greenstone,37,article,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Two years ago, China seemed oblivious to the extraordinary levels of air pollution in many of its cities and the health consequences. But over the past six months, there has been an explosion of information on pollution concentrations, warnings from the media and new policies from the government. It took a long time, but change is happening. Could India be next? In January, India was startled by the release of the annual country rankings of the Yale Environmental Performance Index, which highlighted its troubling air pollution. The calls for change have started: On Monday, the country’s powerful Supreme Court will hear an amicus plea on the worsening pollution in New Delhi. Despite a national election coming in May, air pollution has been largely absent from the debate between the two major political parties, Bharatiya Janata and the Indian National Congress. But many successful Indian environmental policies have come from the Supreme Court, and we encourage it to proceed in this vein by embracing more transparent and flexible market-based regulations to better protect the health of its citizens and allow robust economic growth to continue. Particulate matter air pollution, which is produced primarily by power plants, industry and vehicles, is deadly, causing short- and long-term cardiorespiratory problems such as strokes, heart attacks and cancer. Throughout India, the extreme levels of this pollution are cause for concern. According to the most recent data from India’s Central Pollution Control Board, the 2010 average for respirable particulate matter concentration across 180 monitored Indian cities was six times what the World Health Organization considers safe and twice India’s own national standards. And the concentration in Delhi is about 13 times higher than the W.H.O. guideline. A 2013 study (co-written by one of us, Michael Greenstone) measured the effects of particulate matter on life expectancies in China. It found that an additional 100 micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter in the atmosphere reduced life expectancy at birth by about three years. Using this metric, we estimated that the 200 million people who live in the 180 Indian cities would lose an average of 3.3 years of life because of particulate matter concentrations that exceed India’s standards. This translates into the loss of about 650 million years of life for just the one-sixth of India’s population that lives in these cities. Satellite data makes clear that pollution also exists outside the monitored zones where the other one billion people who make up the rest of India live. So the total loss of life expectancy is much greater. The recent decades of economic growth reflected, in part, significant reductions of regulatory constraints, and the fear of slowing growth has reduced the political will to increase regulations on emissions. But India can continue that growth and provide its citizens with a healthier environment by adopting a regulatory system that is both effective and efficient. India’s current command-and-control style of regulating is handicapped on both counts. It mandates that industrial plants purchase expensive pollution abatement equipment and specifies common pollution standards across the board. Because emissions reductions are much more costly for some plants than for others, these standards are excessively onerous for some and fail to compel the most cost-effective reductions. Regulators at undersourced pollution control boards must rely on infrequent and often unreliable manual monitoring samplings of emissions by their staffs, which in the best case occur only a couple of times per year, to identify the plants that are violating the standards. As a result, expensive pollution abatement technologies that plants are mandated to install are not used efficiently and sometimes not at all. So the outcome is doubly bad: Regulations impose substantial costs on the economy while pollution emissions often exceed the state-mandated limit. Even worse, any violations of these standards are criminal offenses. This means that to penalize violators, regulators must file and win a criminal case in India’s overburdened justice system, making enforcement difficult. So the only potential, swift alternative for regulators is to close down a business — but this, too, is often challenging to enforce. Cap-and-trade would impose a cost on polluters for every unit of pollution emitted and create incentives to reduce those emissions. At the same time, it would decrease the economic burden of regulation by allowing the regulated firms to coordinate among themselves to hit a specific emissions reduction target in the most cost-effective manner. In the 1980s, the United States instituted a cap-and-trade market to solve the problem of acid rain; it greatly reduced sulfur-dioxide emissions at a fraction of the projected cost. However, the American experience makes clear that cap-and-trade succeeds only when governments are fully committed to the enforcement of the rules. India has taken initial steps toward implementing cap-and-trade markets for particulate matter pollution. With guidance from the national regulator, some state regulators are already piloting continuous emissions monitoring and training potential participants for cap-and-trade markets. But more support is necessary to get India’s fledgling cap-and-trade markets off the ground. When the Supreme Court takes this up on Monday, it should consider two key policy changes that would allow India to more efficiently regulate pollution. First, stationary sources, like power and industrial plants, should be required to install continuous emissions monitoring equipment in order to provide reliable real-time reporting of emissions by polluters and to make these data publicly available. While increased transparency about pollution greatly enhances regulators’ effectiveness in its own right, it is also a critical ingredient for a cap-and-trade market. The second critical ingredient: Instead of having to take polluters to court for breaking the law, regulators should be authorized to impose financial penalties on firms that breach emissions regulations. The United States’ successful cap-and-trade markets were, in part, made possible by a little-known but very important part of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that enhanced the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to levy large civil fines on environmental violators. It is also essential that the pilot markets are rigorously evaluated in stages to ensure that regulators and the public are informed about costs and benefits. Pollution is not simply an unavoidable side effect of economic growth, but a reflection of societal choices. Seizing these opportunities for reform would lead to longer and healthier lives.

0,stephen,sestanovich,23,article,"WASHINGTON — IT is easy to forget that when Barack Obama ran for re-election in 2012, his foreign policy was a huge asset. The United States was out of Iraq and doing O.K. in Afghanistan, and had killed Osama bin Laden. Mitt Romney had nothing to shoot at. Today the president finds it harder to explain his global strategy. His emphasis on “nation-building” at home seems to point in one direction, Secretary of State John Kerry’s activist diplomacy in another. Uneasy allies worry that Washington has lost interest in them. Congress is challenging the president on issues from trade to Iran. Critics say American leadership is in decline. The best way to understand Mr. Obama’s predicament is to compare it with that of previous presidents who wound down major wars. He’s not the first to promise a less expensive, more sustainable foreign policy at a time when the country feels overextended. Dwight D. Eisenhower after Korea, Richard M. Nixon after Vietnam, and the first George Bush, after the Cold War, said much the same thing. Their less-is-more record contains good news for Mr. Obama, and clear warnings. The public has always supported presidents who get America out of stalemated wars. In their first terms, Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and Obama reassembled a foreign-policy consensus and were decisively re-elected. Mr. Obama has not lost the argument that America needs relief from global burdens. Polls show the public has no more enthusiasm for the Afghanistan war than he does. National decisions to retrench, moreover, are not quickly reversed. The military build-downs of the 1950s, ’70s and ’90s lasted longer than the buildups before them. The huge post-9/11 surge in Pentagon spending may take a decade to roll back. So, if the president wants a breather to focus resources on domestic needs, he is likely to get it. Past retrenchments bring good news for Mr. Kerry, too. Military downsizing has never ruled out diplomatic activism. The two go hand in hand. To reduce East-West tensions, Eisenhower proposed Atoms for Peace, Open Skies, a nuclear test ban and more. Nixon pursued his “Generation of Peace” through an opening to China, détente with the Soviet Union, and Henry A. Kissinger’s razzle-dazzle Middle East diplomacy. Even the first President Bush, whose last two years were a mini-retrenchment, had his own big-think slogan, a “New World Order.” These presidents sought global stability with less American policing. By comparison, Mr. Obama’s rhetoric is standard stuff. Critics ping him for wanting to heal the planet and reconcile with adversaries. But that’s how presidents in retrenchment talk. Mopping up after disaster requires compensatory inspiration. For Mr. Obama, that is the reassuring part. But play out the comparisons further, and they become less encouraging. Once presidents exit the wars they were elected to fix, their job gets harder. The accompanying diplomacy, energetic at first, tends to sputter and die. In the 1950s, none of Ike’s efforts to reach out to adversaries achieved anything. The “Spirit of Geneva” and “Spirit of Camp David” — labels celebrating his personal summitry — became terms of mockery. In the ’70s, after Nixon’s first visit, relations with China were on hold for years; Mr. Kissinger’s Middle East mediation stalled out after two military disengagements; and “détente” with the Soviets became so controversial that Gerald R. Ford retired the word. An activist foreign policy is hard to sustain on a shrinking material base. In the ’70s Leonid I. Brezhnev rejected the arms-control concessions that American presidents asked of him. He was building more and bigger missiles; the Americans were not. In diplomacy, you need something to bargain with. Retrenchment typically gives you less of it. The Obama administration has built new leverage in one crucial case. A tough American-led sanctions regime has gotten Iran’s attention. Elsewhere, Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry count too much on negotiation to achieve their goals. Ruling out an assertive role in Syria’s civil war reduced American influence over both government and rebels. No surprise, then, that the “Geneva II” peace conference has deadlocked. Resources will test Mr. Obama’s retrenchment strategy in other regions. In 2011, with the Pentagon budget under pressure, the president pledged that spending cuts would not affect American forces in the Pacific. The vow was a crucial element of his “pivot” to East Asia, and the region’s governments and publics will note carefully how fully it is kept. Delivering won’t be easy. The administration has had trouble fulfilling smaller commitments. Early in the Arab Spring, Mr. Obama sketched plans to support democratic evolution in the Middle East. Aides say he is “disappointed” by the poor follow-through on his aid pledges. (But not disappointed enough to push hard to keep them.) History has another sobering lesson: retrenchment always strengthens Congress’s role in foreign policy. Mr. Kissinger raged against legislation that blocked most-favored-nation trading status for the Soviet Union, and covert aid for rebels in Angola. Eisenhower ridiculed Congressional proposals to increase the defense budget. Mr. Obama faces similar pressure. In his recent State of the Union address, he threatened to veto any bill that imposed new sanctions on Iran while talks were underway. Let’s hope he also knows how badly previous administrations handled similar challenges. They were quick to label Congressional critics as extremists or tools of special interests, slow to recognize when the critics had a strong bipartisan base. Mr. Kissinger called the Angola ban a sign of McGovernite Democrats’ nihilism. In fact, Republican senators from Jacob K. Javits to Jesse Helms supported it. Even Eisenhower’s complaint about the influence of the “military-industrial complex” was one volley in a debate he knew he was losing. Those who pushed for greater activism, like John F. Kennedy, already had won. So what’s a retrenchment president to do? If Eisenhower, Nixon and Bush — our best prepared foreign-policy presidents — found it hard to manage a downsized strategy, Mr. Obama should expect the same. He won’t abandon retrenchment, nor does he need to. The domestic foundations of American power do need shoring up. But he needs to tend to its international foundations as well. The president and his advisers sometimes do the opposite. When they say they want to pay less attention to the Middle East, they undermine the president’s own top goals: a nuclear deal with Iran and an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. These may be achievable only if allies and adversaries foresee a more active American role in the region. (Eisenhower, to be fair, didn’t get this either. When Nikita S. Khrushchev threatened West Berlin, Ike proposed cutting American troop levels in Europe. Congressional critics thought he had lost his way.) Mr. Obama would also make retrenchment more effective by rebuilding American global influence. He favors ambitious trade pacts, one for Europe and one for East Asian allies, that cannot succeed without sustained presidential effort. Mr. Obama should recall that the first George Bush, even in his last days as president, managed to sign the North American Free Trade Agreement. Like his predecessors, Mr. Obama rejects the idea that retrenchment means the fading of American power. Anyone who says America is in decline, he harrumphed in his 2012 State of the Union address, “doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” Retrenchment, he believes, is the way to avoid decline. For a candidate seeking re-election, this was smart political positioning. Today, Mr. Obama has to focus on results. He will discover, as past presidents did, that popular views of retrenchment change quickly. After overreaching abroad and underperformance at home, pulling back seems mere common sense. But a strategy for preventing decline can start to look like one that accelerates, and even embraces it. White Houses rarely see this coming. No American president has ever begun a retrenchment and then, as new challenges arose, found the path back to greater activism. Can Barack Obama figure out how to be the first? He’d be making history.",121,106,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/opinion/the-price-of-pulling-back-from-the-world.html,2014-02-10,The Price of Pulling Back From the World
0,,,2721,article,"The political posturing over raising the minimum wage sometimes obscures the huge and growing number of low-wage workers it would affect. An estimated 27.8 million people would earn more money under the Democratic proposal to lift the hourly minimum from $7.25 today to $10.10 by 2016. And most of them do not fit the low-wage stereotype of a teenager with a summer job. Their average age is 35; most work full time; more than one-fourth are parents; and, on average, they earn half of their families’ total income. None of that, however, has softened the hearts of opponents, including congressional Republicans and low-wage employers, notably restaurant owners and executives. This is not a new debate. The minimum wage is a battlefield in a larger political fight between Democrats and Republicans — dating back to the New Deal legislation that instituted the first minimum wage in 1938 — over government’s role in the economy, over raw versus regulated capitalism, over corporate power versus public needs. But the results of the wage debate are clear. Decades of research, facts and evidence show that increasing the minimum wage is vital to the economic security of tens of millions of Americans, and would be good for the weak economy. As Congress begins its own debate, here are answers to some basic questions about the need for an increase. WHAT’S THE POINT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE? Most people think of the minimum wage as the lowest legal hourly pay. That’s true, but it is really much more than that. As defined in the name of the law that established it — the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 — the minimum wage is a fundamental labor standard designed to protect workers, just as child labor laws and overtime pay rules do. Labor standards, like environmental standards and investor protections, are essential to a functional economy. Properly set and enforced, these standards check exploitation, pollution and speculation. In the process, they promote broad and rising prosperity, as well as public confidence. The minimum wage is specifically intended to take aim at the inherent imbalance in power between employers and low-wage workers that can push wages down to poverty levels. An appropriate wage floor set by Congress effectively substitutes for the bargaining power that low-wage workers lack. When low-end wages rise, poverty and inequality are reduced. But that doesn’t mean the minimum wage is a government program to provide welfare, as critics sometimes imply in an attempt to link it to unpopular policies. An hourly minimum of $10.10, for example, as Democrats have proposed, would reduce the number of people living in poverty by 4.6 million, according to widely accepted research, without requiring the government to tax, borrow or spend. IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE? No. Other programs, including food stamps, Medicaid and the earned-income tax credit, also increase the meager resources of low-wage workers, but they do not provide bargaining power to claim a better wage. In fact, they can drive wages down, because  employers who pay poorly factor the government assistance into their wage scales. This is especially true of the earned-income tax credit, a taxpayer-provided wage subsidy that helps lift the income of working families above the poverty line. Conservatives often call for increases to the E.I.T.C. instead of a higher minimum wage, saying that a higher minimum acts as an unfair and unwise tax on low-wage employers. That’s a stretch, especially in light of rising corporate profits even as pay has dwindled. It also ignores how the tax credit increases the supply of low-wage labor by encouraging more people to work, holding down the cost of labor for employers. By one estimate, increasing the tax credit by 10 percent reduces the wages of high-school educated workers by 2 percent. There are good reasons to expand the tax credit for childless workers, as President Obama recently proposed. It is a successful antipoverty program and a capstone in the conservative agenda to emphasize work over welfare. But an expanded E.I.T.C. is no reason to stint on raising the minimum wage — just the opposite. A higher minimum wage could help offset the wage-depressing effect of a bolstered E.I.T.C., and would ensure that both taxpayers and employers do their part to make work pay. HOW HIGH SHOULD IT BE? There’s no perfect way to set the minimum wage, but the most important benchmarks — purchasing power, wage growth and productivity growth — demonstrate that the current $7.25 an hour is far too low. They also show that the proposed increase to $10.10 by 2016 is too modest. The peak year for the minimum wage was 1968, when its purchasing power was nearly $9.40 in 2013 dollars, as shown in the accompanying chart. Since then, the erosion caused by inflation has obviously overwhelmed the increases by Congress. Even a boost to $10.10 an hour by 2016 (also adjusted to 2013 dollars) would lift the minimum to just above its real value in 1968. So while it is better than no increase, it is hardly a raise. The situation is worse when the minimum wage is compared with the average wages of typical American workers, the ones with production and nonsupervisory jobs in the private sector. From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, when one full-time, full-year minimum wage job could keep a family of two above the poverty line, the minimum equaled about half of the average wage. Today, it has fallen to one-third; to restore it to half would require nearly $11 an hour, a better goal than $10.10. The problem is that the average wage, recently $20.39 an hour, has also stagnated over the past several decades, despite higher overall education levels for typical workers and despite big increases in labor productivity. People are working harder and churning out more goods and services, but there’s no sign of that in their paychecks. If the average wage had kept pace with those productivity gains, it would be about $36 an hour today, and the minimum wage, at half the average, would be about $18. That is not to suggest that the hourly minimum wage could be catapulted from $7.25 to $18. A minimum of $18 would be untenable with the average hovering in the low $20s. But it does confirm that impersonal market forces are not the only, or even the primary, reason for widespread wage stagnation. Flawed policies and changing corporate norms are also to blame, because they have allowed the benefits of productivity gains to flow increasingly to profits, shareholder returns and executive pay, instead of workers’ wages. DOES IT KILL JOBS? The minimum wage is one of the most thoroughly researched issues in economics. Studies in the last 20 years have been especially informative, as economists have been able to compare states that raised the wage above the federal level with those that did not. The weight of the evidence shows that increases in the minimum wage have lifted pay without hurting employment, a point that was driven home in a recent letter to Mr. Obama and congressional leaders, signed by more than 600 economists, among them Nobel laureates and past presidents of the American Economic Association. That economic conclusion dovetails with a recent comprehensive study, which found that minimum wage increases resulted in “strong earnings effects” — that is, higher pay — “and no employment effects” — that is, zero job loss. Evidence, however, does not stop conservatives from making the argument that by raising the cost of labor, a higher minimum wage will hurt businesses, leading them to cut jobs and harming the low-wage workers it is intended to help. Alternatively, they argue it will hurt consumers by pushing up prices precipitously. Those arguments are simplistic. Research and experience show that employers do not automatically cope with a higher minimum wage by laying off workers or not hiring new ones. Instead, they pay up out of savings from reduced labor turnover, by slower wage increases higher up the scale, modest price increases or other adjustments. Which brings the debate over raising the minimum wage full circle. The real argument against it is political, not economic. Republican opposition will likely keep any future increase in the minimum wage below a level that would constitute a firm wage floor, though an increase to $10.10 an hour would help tens of millions of workers. It also would help the economy by supporting consumer spending that in turn supports job growth. It is not a cure-all; it is not bold or innovative. But it is on the legislative agenda, and it deserves to pass.",6098,3723,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/the-case-for-a-higher-minimum-wage.html,2014-02-09,The Case for a Higher Minimum Wage
0,nicholas,kristof,2613,article,"CHICAGO — THE largest mental health center in America is a huge compound here in Chicago, with thousands of people suffering from manias, psychoses and other disorders, all surrounded by high fences and barbed wire. Just one thing: It’s a jail. The only way to get treatment is to be arrested. Psychiatric disorders are the only kind of sickness that we as a society regularly respond to not with sympathy but with handcuffs and incarceration. And as more humane and cost-effective ways of treating mental illness have been cut back, we increasingly resort to the law-enforcement toolbox: jails and prisons. More than half of prisoners in the United States have a mental health problem, according to a 2006 Justice Department study. Among female inmates, almost three-quarters have a mental disorder. In the jail here, some prisoners sit on their beds all day long, lost in their delusions, oblivious to their surroundings, hearing voices, sometimes talking back to them. The first person to say that this system is barbaric is their jailer. “It’s criminalizing mental illness,” the Cook County sheriff, Thomas Dart, told me as he showed me the jail, on a day when 60 percent of the jail’s intake reported that they had been diagnosed with mental illness. Dart says the system is abhorrent and senseless, as well as an astronomically expensive way to treat mental illness — but that he has no choice but to accept schizophrenic, bipolar, depressive and psychotic prisoners delivered by local police forces. People are not officially incarcerated because of psychiatric ailments, but that’s the unintended effect. Sheriff Dart says that although some mentally ill people commit serious crimes, the great majority are brought in for offenses that flow from mental illness. One 47-year-old man I spoke to, George, (I’m not permitted to use last names for legal reasons) is bipolar, hears voices and abuses drugs and alcohol. He said he had been arrested five times since October for petty offenses. The current offense is criminal trespass for refusing to leave a Laundromat. The sheriff says such examples are common and asks: “How will we be viewed, 20, 30, 50 years from now? We’ll be looked on as the ones who locked up all the mentally ill people. “It really is one of those things so rich with irony: The same society that abhorred the idea that we lock people up in mental hospitals, now we lock people up in jails.” A few data snapshots: • Nationwide in America, more than three times as many mentally ill people are housed in prisons and jails as in hospitals, according to a 2010 study by the National Sheriffs’ Association and the Treatment Advocacy Center. • Mentally ill inmates are often preyed upon while incarcerated, or disciplined because of trouble following rules. They are much more likely than other prisoners, for example, to be injured in a fight in jail, the Justice Department says. • Some 40 percent of people with serious mental illnesses have been arrested at some point in their lives. In the 1800s, Dorothea Dix led a campaign against the imprisonment of the mentally ill, leading to far-reaching reforms and the establishment of mental hospitals. Now we as a society have, in effect, returned to the 1800s. Among those jailed here is Russell, 46, who is being held for burglarizing a garage. He has been diagnosed with severe depression and said that he self-medicates with alcohol and drugs. Most of his adult life has been spent behind bars for one offense after another, and he said he became aware of his mental health problems when he was being clubbed by a thug with a baseball bat and realized that he was enjoying it. “I just want to be normal,” he said as we spoke in a large dormitory room for inmates with psychiatric problems. “I want to have a job. I’ve never had a job. I want to be able to say hi to a co-worker.” He stopped, and there were tears in his eyes. In 1955, there was one bed in a psychiatric ward for every 300 Americans; now there is one for every 3,000 Americans, the 2010 study said. So while more effective pharmacological treatments are theoretically available, they are often very difficult to access for people who are only borderline functional. “Some people come here to get medication,” says Ardell Hall, a superintendent of a women’s unit at the jail. “They commit a crime to get in.” India, a 42-year-old woman, suffers from manic depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. She said she tried at various times to get psychiatric care but found it almost impossible, so she self-medicates when on the outside with heroin — and has spent almost all of her adult life in jails and prisons on a succession of nonviolent offenses relating to drugs and shoplifting. TAXPAYERS spend as much as $300 or $400 a day supporting patients with psychiatric disorders while they are in jail, partly because the mentally ill require medication and extra supervision and care. “Fiscally, this is the stupidest thing I’ve seen government do,” Dart says. It would be far cheaper, he adds, to manage the mentally ill with a case worker on the outside than to spend such sums incarcerating them. Cook County has implemented an exemplary system for mental health support for inmates. While in jail, they often stabilize. Then they are released, go off their medications and the cycle repeats. One woman in the jail, Kristen, said she had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders. On the outside, her prescription medication cost $100 a month, so she skipped it. “When I’m not on my medicine on a regular basis, I don’t make decisions well,” she said, explaining her long arrest record for theft and narcotics offenses. I asked her if access to medicine would keep her out of jail, and she said: “I don’t know if that’s necessarily true, to be totally honest. But it would help.” As Sheriff Dart puts it: “We’ve systematically shut down all the mental health facilities, so the mentally ill have nowhere else to go. We’ve become the de facto mental health hospital.” Do we really want to go back two centuries? Doesn’t that seem not only inhumane but also deluded — on our part?",5295,3844,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/inside-a-mental-hospital-called-jail.html,2014-02-09,Inside a Mental Hospital Called Jail
0,gary,taubes,4096,article,"NEARLY six weeks into the 2014 diet season, it’s a good bet that many of us who made New Year’s resolutions to lose weight have already peaked. If clinical trials are any indication, we’ve lost much of the weight we can expect to lose. In a year or two we’ll be back within half a dozen pounds of where we are today. The question is why. Is this a failure of willpower or of technique? Was our chosen dietary intervention — whether from the latest best-selling diet book or merely a concerted attempt to eat less and exercise more — doomed to failure? Considering that obesity and its related diseases — most notably, Type 2 diabetes — now cost the health care system more than $1 billion per day, it’s not hyperbolic to suggest that the health of the nation may depend on which is the correct answer. Since the 1960s, nutrition science has been dominated by two conflicting observations. One is that we know how to eat healthy and maintain a healthy weight. The other is that the rapidly increasing rates of obesity and diabetes suggest that something about the conventional thinking is simply wrong. In 1960, fewer than 13 percent of Americans were obese, and diabetes had been diagnosed in 1 percent. Today, the percentage of obese Americans has almost tripled; the percentage of Americans with diabetes has increased sevenfold. Meanwhile, the research literature on obesity has also ballooned. In 1960, fewer than 1,100 articles were published on obesity or diabetes in the indexed medical literature. Last year it was more than 44,000. In total, over 600,000 articles have been published purporting to convey some meaningful information on these conditions. It would be nice to think that this deluge of research has brought clarity to the issue. The trend data argue otherwise. If we understand these disorders so well, why have we failed so miserably to prevent them? The conventional explanation is that this is the manifestation of an unfortunate reality: Type 2 diabetes is caused or exacerbated by obesity, and obesity is a complex, intractable disorder. The more we learn, the more we need to know. Here’s another possibility: The 600,000 articles — along with several tens of thousands of diet books — are the noise generated by a dysfunctional research establishment. Because the nutrition research community has failed to establish reliable, unambiguous knowledge about the environmental triggers of obesity and diabetes, it has opened the door to a diversity of opinions on the subject, of hypotheses about cause, cure and prevention, many of which cannot be refuted by the existing evidence. Everyone has a theory. The evidence doesn’t exist to say unequivocally who’s wrong. The situation is understandable; it’s a learning experience in the limits of science. The protocol of science is the process of hypothesis and test. This three-word phrase, though, does not do it justice. The philosopher Karl Popper did when he described “the method of science as the method of bold conjectures and ingenious and severe attempts to refute them.”  In nutrition, the hypotheses are speculations about what foods or dietary patterns help or hinder our pursuit of a long and healthy life. The ingenious and severe attempts to refute the hypotheses are the experimental tests — the clinical trials and, to be specific, randomized controlled trials. Because the hypotheses are ultimately about what happens to us over decades, meaningful trials are prohibitively expensive and exceedingly difficult.  It means convincing thousands of people to change what they eat for years to decades. Eventually enough heart attacks, cancers and deaths have to happen among the subjects so it can be established whether the dietary intervention was beneficial or detrimental. And before any of this can even be attempted, someone’s got to pay for it. Since no pharmaceutical company stands to benefit, prospective sources are limited, particularly when we insist the answers are already known. Without such trials, though, we’re only guessing whether we know the truth. Back in the 1960s, when researchers first took seriously the idea that dietary fat caused heart disease, they acknowledged that such trials were necessary and studied the feasibility for years. Eventually the leadership at the National Institutes of Health concluded that the trials would be too expensive — perhaps a billion dollars — and might get the wrong answer anyway. They might botch the study and never know it. They certainly couldn’t afford to do two such studies, even though replication is a core principle of the scientific method. Since then, advice to restrict fat or avoid saturated fat has been based on suppositions about what would have happened had such trials been done, not on the studies themselves. Nutritionists have adjusted to this reality by accepting a lower standard of evidence on what they’ll believe to be true. They do experiments with laboratory animals, for instance, following them for the better part of the animal’s lifetime — a year or two in rodents, say — and assume or at least hope that the results apply to humans. And maybe they do, but we can’t know for sure without doing the human experiments. They do experiments on humans — the species of interest — for days or weeks or even a year or two and then assume that the results apply to decades. And maybe they do, but we can’t know for sure. That’s a hypothesis, and it must be tested. And they do what are called observational studies, observing populations for decades, documenting what people eat and what illnesses beset them, and then assume that the associations they observe between diet and disease are indeed causal — that if people who eat copious vegetables, for instance, live longer than those who don’t, it’s the vegetables that cause the effect of a longer life. And maybe they do, but there’s no way to know without experimental trials to test that hypothesis. The associations that emerge from these studies used to be known as “hypothesis-generating data,” based on the fact that an association tells us only that two things changed together in time, not that one caused the other. So associations generate hypotheses of causality that then have to be tested. But this hypothesis-generating caveat has been dropped over the years as researchers studying nutrition have decided that this is the best they can do.   One lesson of science, though, is that if the best you can do isn’t good enough to establish reliable knowledge, first acknowledge it — relentless honesty about what can and cannot be extrapolated from data is another core principle of science — and then do more, or do something else. As it is, we have a field of sort-of-science in which hypotheses are treated as facts because they’re too hard or expensive to test, and there are so many hypotheses that what journalists like to call “leading authorities” disagree with one another daily. It’s an unacceptable situation. Obesity and diabetes are epidemic, and yet the only relevant fact on which relatively unambiguous data exist to support a consensus is that most of us are surely eating too much of something. (My vote is sugars and refined grains; we all have our biases.) Making meaningful inroads against obesity and diabetes on a population level requires that we know how to treat and prevent it on an individual level. We’re going to have to stop believing we know the answer, and challenge ourselves to come up with trials that do a better job of testing our beliefs. Before I, for one, make another dietary resolution, I’d like to know that what I believe I know about a healthy diet is really so. Is that too much to ask?",15135,7749,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/why-nutrition-is-so-confusing.html,2014-02-09,Why Nutrition Is So Confusing
0,phil,klay,920,article,"“I COULD never imagine what you’ve been through,” she said. As a former Marine who served in Iraq, I’d heard the sentiment before — it’s the civilian counterpart to the veteran’s “You wouldn’t know, you weren’t there.” But this time it struck an especially discordant note. This woman was a friend. She’d read something I’d written about Iraq — about the shocked numbness I’d felt looking at the victims of a suicide bombing — and it had resonated. As a survivor of child abuse, she knew feelings of shocked numbness far better than I did. And yet, midway through recounting some of what happened to her as a young girl, she said it again: “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to compare my experience to yours. I could never imagine what you’ve been through.” It felt inappropriate to respond, “Sure you could.” I’d had a mild deployment. She’d mainly have to imagine long hours at a cheap plywood desk in a cheap plywood hut in the middle of a desert. True, there were a handful of alarming but anti-climactic mortar attacks on my forward operating base, and the wounded and damaged bodies I saw at the trauma center, but that was all. Her childhood, though, was full of experiences I couldn’t have handled as an adult, let alone as a child. And what was particularly bewildering was that, even as my friend was insisting that what I’d been through was beyond the limits of imagination, she never once told me, “You aren’t a victim of child abuse. You couldn’t understand.” She wanted me to understand. At the very least, she wanted me to try. I know an airman who suffered a traumatic brain injury during training just a few years after being in a car accident where he watched his twin brother die. When he tells people about the T.B.I. and the accident and his service, he invariably gets the “I could never imagine” line. “It makes me angry,” he told me. Sure, he wants to say, you don’t think you could understand, but what if I want you to? It’s a difficult spot to be in, for both. The civilian wants to respect what the veteran has gone through. The veteran wants to protect memories that are painful and sacred to him from outside judgment. But the result is the same: the veteran in a corner by himself, able to proclaim about war but not discuss it, and the civilian shut out from a conversation about one of the most morally fraught activities our nation engages in — war. The notion that war forever separates veterans from the rest of mankind has been long embedded in our collective consciousness. After World War I, the poet and veteran Siegfried Sassoon wrote, “the man who really endured the war at its worst was everlastingly differentiated from everyone except his fellow soldiers.” During World War II, Hemingway called combat “that thing which no one knows about who has not done it.” After Vietnam, Tim O’Brien claimed that a true war story can’t even be told, because “sometimes it’s just beyond telling.” Given the way American history, unlike Iraqi or Afghan history, allows for a neat division between soldiers who see war and civilians who don’t, it’s not surprising that the idea has taken root. When I returned from Iraq, people often asked me what it was like, usually followed by, “How are we doing over there?” And I’d tell them. I’d explain in bold, confident terms about the surge and the Sunni Awakening. The Iraq I returned from was, in my mind, a fairly simple place. By which I mean it had little relationship to reality. It’s only with time and the help of smart, empathetic friends willing to pull through many serious conversations that I’ve been able to learn more about what I witnessed. And many of those conversations were with friends who’d never served. We pay political consequences when civilians are excused or excluded from discussion of war. After all, veterans are no more or less trustworthy than any other group of fallible human beings. Southern veterans of the Civil War claimed the Confederacy was a noble lost cause. Nazi leaders who had served in World War I claimed that the German troops had all but won the war, only to be stabbed in the back by civilians in thrall to Jewish interests. The notion that the veteran is an unassailable authority on the experience of war shuts down conversation. But in a democracy, no one, not even a veteran, should have the last word.  The problem is compounded on a personal level. If we fetishize trauma as incommunicable then survivors are trapped — unable to feel truly known by their nonmilitary friends and family. At a recent Veterans Day performance put on by Arts in the Armed Forces, Adam Driver, the organization’s founder, a former Marine turned actor, spoke of his feelings of alienation after leaving the corps. “Not being able to express the anger, confusion and loneliness I felt was challenging,” he said, until theater exposed him “to playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military, that were articulating experiences I had in the military, that before to me were indescribable.” It’s a powerful moment, when you discover a vocabulary exists for something you’d thought incommunicably unique. Personally, I felt it reading Joseph Conrad’s “Lord Jim.” I have friends who’ve found themselves described in everything from science fiction to detective novels. This self-recognition through others is not simply a by-product of art — it’s the whole point. Hegel once wrote, “The nature of humanity is to drive men to agreement with one another, and humanity’s existence lies only in the commonality of consciousness that has been brought about.” To enter into that commonality of consciousness, though, veterans need an audience that is both receptive and critical. Believing war is beyond words is an abrogation of responsibility — it lets civilians off the hook from trying to understand, and veterans off the hook from needing to explain. You don’t honor someone by telling them, “I can never imagine what you’ve been through.” Instead, listen to their story and try to imagine being in it, no matter how hard or uncomfortable that feels. If the past 10 years have taught us anything, it’s that in the age of an all-volunteer military, it is far too easy for Americans to send soldiers on deployment after deployment without making a serious effort to imagine what that means. We can do better.",3300,1649,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/after-war-a-failure-of-the-imagination.html,2014-02-09,"After War, a Failure of the Imagination"
0,ross,douthat,358,article,"IN 1930, in the darkening valley of the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes wrote an essay on “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” which foresaw a much happier future — one of growth, abundance and the steady decline of full-time work. Eventually, he suggested, civilization might settle on a 15-hour workweek, with three hours of daily labor being sufficient “to satisfy the old Adam in most of us.” Compared with its Depression-era baseline, much of Keynes’s optimistic vision was prophetic. But the universal 15-hour workweek is not exactly with us yet. Instead, a different trend seems to be emerging, in which well-educated professionals — inspired by rising pay and status-obsessed competition — often work longer hours than they did a few decades ago, while poorer Americans, especially poorer men, are increasingly disconnected from the labor force entirely. (That this trend coincides with widening inequality is not coincidental.) When economists look ahead to the possibilities awaiting our grandchildren, they often see this divide widening even further, as the digital economy delivers rich rewards to certain kinds of highly educated talent, while revolutions in robotics eliminate many of today’s low-skilled, low-wage jobs. This context is crucial to understanding the debate that erupted last week over Obamacare’s impact on work-force participation. The Congressional Budget Office had always predicted that the new health care law’s mix of direct benefits and indirect incentives would encourage some people to cut their hours or leave their jobs outright. But its latest report revised the estimate substantially upward, predicting that by 2021, the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers — most of them low-wage — could disappear from the American economy. That big number prompted Republicans to recycle their predictions that the health care law would be a “job killer.” As liberals retorted, this is not exactly right: These would be working hours freely given up, not jobs lost in huge Obamacare-induced layoffs. Any health care reform worthy of the name would have some version of this effect: If you weaken the link between insurance and employment, workers will have one less reason to stay at a job they dislike. And it’s easy to envision cases where the ability to reduce one’s working hours would be an unmitigated good — for ailing near-retirees, for parents of young children. At the same time, though, the design of Obamacare — Medicaid expansion, subsidies for comprehensive rather than catastrophic coverage, and then the way the subsidy disappears if you get a raise or take a higher-paying job — makes the work disincentive much more substantial than it would be under, say, a conservative alternative that offers everyone a flat credit to buy a catastrophic plan. So the new law’s impact on work will be felt well beyond families juggling jobs and child care. One of the studies used to model the consequences of Obamacare, for instance, found a strong work disincentive while looking at a population of childless, able-bodied, mostly working-class adults — a demographic that’s already becoming more and more detached from steady, paying work. And this is where liberalism has a very important choice to make. It’s possible to defend Obamacare’s overall goals while also recognizing its potentially perverse effects, and conceding that we should try to minimize the number of low-skilled workers exiting the labor market. But it’s also possible to argue that as a rich, post-scarcity society, we shouldn’t really care that much about whether the poor choose to work. The important thing is just making sure they have a decent standard of living, full stop, and if they choose Keynesian leisure over a low-paying job, that’s their business. There are hints of a division within the liberal mind on this issue. Across the left and center-left, there’s agreement that an unequal society requires a thicker social safety net, and that as technological changes undercut low-wage work, government should help those left behind. But in the Obamacare debate and elsewhere, it’s not always clear whether this larger welfare state is supposed to promote a link between work, security and mobility, or to substitute for work’s gradual decline. On the left, there’s a growing tendency toward both pessimism and utopianism — with doubts about the compatibility of capitalism and democracy, and skepticism about the possibility for true equality of opportunity, feeding a renewed interest in 1970s-era ideas like a universal basic income. On the conservative side, things are somewhat clearer. There are libertarians who like the basic income idea, but only as a substitute for the existing welfare state, not as a new expansion. Both “rugged individualist” right-wingers and more communitarian conservatives tend to see work as essential to dignity, mobility and social equality, and see its decline as something to be fiercely resisted. The question is whether tomorrow’s liberals will be our allies in that fight.",118,242,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/douthat-leaving-work-behind.html,2014-02-09,Leaving Work Behind
0,serge,schmemann,13,article,"From their inception in the 1890s, the modern Olympic Games have differed from other sporting tournaments (the Super Bowl, for example, on which more later) in the overlay of idealism that Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the modern Games, concocted from the mythology of the ancient Greek Games and his own 19th-century aristocratic sporting traditions. Never mind that his idealized Olympic Games have long given way to commercialism, professionalism, corruption, politics and boycotts; the notion that the Games somehow elevate the world above its usual sordid nastiness has remained an integral part of their image. Still, it was somewhat stunning to hear President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia telling the International Olympic Committee last Tuesday, in English, “We feel truly joyful and positive because the mighty, inspiring spirit of the Olympic Games is once again returning to our nation.” The last time the mighty spirit visited his land was in 1980, when it was the Soviet Union and the Moscow Games were boycotted by the United States and some of its allies over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Yet perhaps some of that spirit was, in fact, back as the pre-Olympic spotlight focused on the homophobic law Mr. Putin pushed through last summer, or on the staggering $50 billion reportedly spent preparing Sochi for the Games — which will be more than the combined cost of all previous Winter Olympics — or on security concerns. Like previous presidents of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, the incumbent, was indignant at political leaders who, he said, marred the Games with “ostentatious gestures like not showing up to the opening ceremony” But politics has always been an integral part of the Games — think of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the Black Power salute by two African-American athletes during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Mexico City Games, the terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Games, or the Cold War boycotts in 1980 and 1984. It is difficult to imagine how it could have been different with the mighty, inspiring spirit back in Mr. Putin’s Russia. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, deftly wove the ideals and the politics on Thursday when he declared that the United Nations and the I.O.C. were a “dynamic global duo” with shared values of universality, solidarity and nondiscrimination — and then declared that those values don’t include any discrimination against “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people.” The bottom line is that the Olympics are still one of the world’s greatest spectacles and greatest tournaments and will dominate the world’s attention for the next two weeks. And I confess that the Russians do throw a great opening ceremony, what with the girl lofted on high behind a kite, the floating islands of birch trees or the snow-flecked shapkas. It is curious to ponder what Monsieur de Coubertin would think of all this. A Rout’s Super Numbers But it is even more interesting to ponder the good baron’s reaction had he been in New Jersey for the Super Bowl last Sunday. This greatest of American sports spectacles makes no pretense to idealism, gentlemanly restraint or bringing peace to the world. This is an American game, a combination of intricate strategies, complex rules and brutal clashes that few in the world can fathom. It’s all about excess, commerce, noise, excitement and ferocity — even the TV commercials, at an astounding $4 million for a 30-second pop, get celebrity treatment, with their own YouTube spoofs and chat groups. I watched the Super Bowl on TV in Paris, in French, and the announcer, Samyr Hamoudi, who had played “football américain” in France — yes, there are some European teams — made a heroic effort at explaining how it worked. But then I suspect even American announcers had a hard time explaining what didn’t work for Peyton Manning and his pathetic Denver Broncos from the opening flub to the utterly lopsided 43-8 conclusion. The Seattle Seahawks were already at 22-0 by halftime, and early in the second half my brother-in-law texted that he was switching to “Downton Abbey” on PBS, where Lady Edith learned that she had fallen pregnant and the party girl Rose was caught embracing a black bandleader she had invited to the Abbey as a surprise for Lord Grantham. Still, there was no loser in the end in the all-important game of ratings. Super Bowl XLVIII got the largest television audience in American history, with Nielsen reporting that 111.5 million viewers in the United States watched the game (in France, I can confirm that there were at least four of us). And “Downton Abbey” averaged 6.8 million viewers to top all anti-Super Bowl programs for the third straight year. Citius, Altius, Fortius. Farewell to an Artist There is a special sadness when a great performer dies young. We become accustomed to seeing a star, a celebrity, an artist; we read of their trials and loves as if they were fiction, and often they are. And suddenly we learn that there was a real person behind the star, a person we never got to meet, who had real relationships, real doubts, real pain. We accord them a special place in our cultural pantheon — River Phoenix, Heath Ledger, Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson. On Sunday, one of the best actors of his generation, Philip Seymour Hoffman, was found dead at his apartment in New York. Though the autopsy reports have not been conclusive, Mr. Hoffman, 46, was found with a needle still in his arm, and he had acknowledged struggles with heroin addiction. Since his death, there have been many articles about his life, his love of theater, his extraordinary talent. None of them can fully explain why he used drugs, but they do give us some sense of the intense emotional and physical exertions required of someone who fully lives not only his own life, but the life of each of the people he portrays. All who saw Mr. Hoffman in different roles were astounded by how fully and convincingly he became the other person. In a portrait of Mr. Hoffman written five years ago in The New York Times Magazine, Lynn Hirschberg described how the 12-year-old Philip was profoundly affected by a local theater production of “All My Sons.” “When I saw ‘All My Sons,’ I was changed — permanently changed — by that experience,” Mr. Hoffman told Ms. Hirschberg. “It was like a miracle to me. But that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it’s torturous because you know it’s a beautiful thing. I was young once, and I said, That’s beautiful and I want that. Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great — well, that’s absolutely torturous.” We know now how torturous it really was. But it was a beautiful thing.",48,15,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/the-games-begin-in-russia-and-an-actors-life-ends-in-new-york.html,2014-02-09,"The Games Begin in Russia, and an Actor’s Life Ends in New York"
0,margaret,sullivan,15,article,"WHATEVER one may think of the current debate over impartiality in journalism, one thing is certain: No writer comes to his or her work as a blank slate.   Journalists bring their backgrounds, their beliefs, perhaps their faith, their politics, and their relationships to what they do.  Traditional journalism says: “Set those aside.  Be as objective as possible.” A newer line of thought says: “Be who you are and own it. Just tell readers where you’re coming from.” Three recent situations at The Times, where a writer’s impartiality has come under fire, may be worth examining in that context. The situations are all very different, as are the approaches to “here’s where I’m coming from.” The first — and my main subject here — is a book review by Janet Maslin, one of The Times’s staff book critics, of Gabriel Sherman’s examination of Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, titled “The Loudest Voice in the Room.”  The review was negative, calling the book “disingenuous” and criticizing its anonymous sources. After it appeared, Mr. Sherman wrote to me complaining that Ms. Maslin did not disclose a longtime friendship with someone he portrays in an unflattering light: Peter J. Boyer, now editor-at-large at Fox News. The second is a column and accompanying blog post by Nicholas Kristof, an Op-Ed columnist at The Times, that takes up the case of Dylan Farrow, an adopted daughter of Woody Allen, who details her memories of childhood sexual abuse by the filmmaker. (He makes his own case in an Op-Ed article on Sunday.) To his credit, Mr. Kristof is clear about where he’s coming from — he is a longtime friend of Mia Farrow’s. But was that enough? Given the close relationship with the Farrows, complete fairness might not have been possible here, some readers said. In other words, disclosure was absolutely necessary but still might not have been sufficient. And the third is the coverage of Israel by Isabel Kershner, a Times contract writer (not a staff member). She is married to Hirsh Goodman, whose strong views on Israeli politics are well known, and who recently wrote an Op-Ed piece in The Times. Their relationship was not disclosed in the Op-Ed piece, nor has it been in the context of her articles.  Some readers have told me they object to that and, what’s more, that the relationship makes them question Ms. Kershner’s ability to report fairly. The foreign editor, Joseph Kahn, disagrees: “We have laid down very clear rules of the road for her in her reporting for us, and have no reason to suspect that she has strayed from those in the years since this became an issue. Her husband is entitled to his own views and his own career. Our concern as a newsroom is with Isabel, not with her spouse or her relatives.” It’s a tricky subject, one that’s been worked over by my predecessors. Certainly, obvious conflict of interest must be avoided — the reporter shouldn’t (and doesn’t) cover her husband. But most of all, judge the reporter by her work. Mentioning a marital relationship in every piece of reporting would not only be awkward; it’s unnecessary. Disclosure should be made when a writer has a conflicting relationship with what or whom she’s writing about. At most, Ms. Kershner’s situation puts an extra onus on editors to make sure the work is sound; they seem well aware of that. Let’s look more deeply at the book-review situation. Ms. Maslin confirmed that she has had a longstanding friendship with Mr. Boyer, and that she knew he appeared in the book. (His role there is minor: in one chapter, and not at great length even there.) In an email, she described a practice among staff book critics that surprised me. “When we have conflicts of interest regarding friends who figure in books, we NEVER mention the friends,” she wrote. Instead, “we decide we can’t review the books.” In this case, she realized that there were two considerations; she had longstanding friendships with Mr. Boyer and with Peter Kaplan, the late New York Observer editor, whom Mr. Sherman has called his mentor. The references seemed tangential, she said, and, after discussing them with her editor, she took on the book review. Mr. Sherman told me that he is “very disturbed that a personal friend of a subject of my book was allowed to review the book without disclosing that relationship to Times readers.” My sense is that Mr. Sherman is mostly unhappy about the review itself, but his point is worth considering. I asked The Times’s culture editor, Danielle Mattoon, about the practice. “The critics are our authorities and I trust them,” she said, noting that they have great autonomy. “Their taking on the book for review means there’s no conflict.” What she asks of critics, she said, is “an honest response to a book on its own merits,” and she feels confident that’s what happened here. I understand that the practice of reviewing books at The Times — both by the three staff critics in the arts pages and by freelance reviewers in the separately run Book Review — has a long, storied history and well-established practices. But this review (which, overall, I have no quarrel with) would have benefited from a phrase or sentence of disclosure. In a world where, increasingly, “transparency is the new objectivity,” there should be no hesitation about disclosure when it’s appropriate. In fact, it will enrich the conversation and deepen the reader’s understanding.  You can follow the public editor on Twitter at twitter.com/sulliview and on the Public Editor’s Journal, at nytimes.com/publiceditor, where recent topics included the development of a breaking news story concerning Gov.

0,thomas,friedman,219,article,"HEBRON, West Bank — It was not your usual Holy Land tour, but surely one of the most revealing I’ve ever had. A team from Friends of the Earth Middle East took me around to see how waste, sewage and untreated water flow, or don’t, between Israel and the West Bank. I never realized how political garbage and dirty water could be, or how tracking it could reveal just why making peace here is so urgent. For starters, who knew that when you flush the toilet in your hotel in the eastern half of Jerusalem the wastewater likely ends up in the Dead Sea — untreated? It flows from Jerusalem’s sewers into the Kidron Stream. If you can stand the stench, you can watch it all rush by about a mile east and downhill from Jerusalem. Germany offered to pay for a treatment plant, but for the past 20 years Israel and the Palestinian Authority have not been able to agree on how to split the treated water — which originates in both Jewish and Arab drains, so nothing has happened. As a result, Mother Nature alone does her best to filter it as it flows down to the Jordan Valley, where Jewish settlers use some of this poorly treated water to irrigate their date palms. The rest ends up in the Dead Sea. Good thing it’s already dead. We’ve learned in the last few years that the colonial boundaries of the Middle East do not correspond to the ethnic, sectarian and tribal boundaries — and it is one reason that some Arab states are breaking up. But neither do the ecosystem boundaries correspond with any borders or walls. And the fact that Israelis and Palestinians have not been able to reach a power-sharing agreement that would enable them to treat the entire ecosystem here as a system is catching up with them. When the region got hit in January 2013 with snow and rain from a freak and massive storm, the runoff was so powerful down the Alexander Stream, which flows from the Shomron Mountains near the West Bank town of Nablus into Israel, that it overflowed. So instead of going under the thick cement wall Israel has erected around the West Bank to keep out Palestinian suicide bombers, the flood blew away a whole chunk of that wall. Mother Nature laughs at our “green lines.” Now consider what is going on in the Hebron Industrial Zone, home to 13 tanning factories, including the Al-Walied for Leather and Tanning Company, where hides are hanging everywhere from the ceiling and a single worker is putting them through a machine that squeezes out the moisture from the softening process. The problem, explained Malek Abu al-Failat, from the Bethlehem office of Friends of the Earth Middle East, which brings Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians together on one team, is that the tanneries use chromium 3 to soften the hides and then let the effluence flow into the drains and down the Hebron Stream. That effluence exceeds 5,000 milligrams of chromium 3 per liter. The global safety standard is 5 milligrams! When the chromium 3 hits the water and oxygen, it becomes chromium 6, a known carcinogen. So, in 1998, the U.S. Agency for International Development built a treatment plant here that effectively extracts all the chromium 3 and recycles it. But, in 2005, Israel identified the sulfuric acid used in the recycling as a dual-use chemical that Palestinians could employ to make a bomb and banned its use by tanners. So the chromium 6 is now back in the water, which flows from Hebron to Beersheba, one of Israel’s largest cities, and then on to Gaza and out to sea, into waters used by Israel’s desalination plants. We visited the Al-Minya Sanitary Landfill that was built with grants from the World Bank, European Union and USAID so Palestinians could close down 19 unauthorized and unsanitary dump sites around Bethlehem and Hebron. It was supposed to open in September, but, as I saw, its 65 acres were still pristine because the Israeli military told the Palestinian Authority that if the site didn’t also accept garbage from the Gush Etzion Jewish settlements it could not open, said Failat. Palestinians say it’s unfair that they lose their land to settlements and then have to accept their garbage. Meanwhile, Gaza, which has been woefully mismanaged by Hamas, is pumping all its drinking water from its coastal aquifer at triple its renewable rate of recharge. As a result, saltwater is seeping in. Last year, the U.N. said that by 2016 there will be no potable water left in Gaza’s main aquifer. Gaza has no big desalination plant and would not have the electricity to run it anyway. I don’t want to be here when 1.5 million Gazans really get thirsty. Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians actually have all the resources needed to take care of everyone, but only if they collaborate, explained Gidon Bromberg, co-founder of Friends of the Earth Middle East. Israel, which is the world leader in desalination and wastewater recycling, could use its own cheap natural gas and solar power generated in Jordan — where there is lots of sunny desert —  “to provide desalinated and recycled water for itself, Gaza, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.” Everyone would win, which is why Bromberg suggests that Secretary of State John Kerry take Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on an eco-tour to see “the seeping time bomb that’s ticking underneath both of them.” It, too, will explode if they don’t forge a deal that enables them to live apart, but in a framework that also enables them to work together to protect the water, soil and air that they will always have in common and can only be preserved by acting in common.",651,556,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/friedman-whose-garbage-is-this-anyway.html,2014-02-09,Whose Garbage Is This Anyway?
0,frank,bruni,198,article,"THE pope, a porn star and a parrot walk into a bar. Well, almost. Their point of intersection just a week and a half ago was actually St. Peter’s Square, and “porn star” stretches things: The performer in question was reportedly a former male stripper who had graduated to racy movies and, this being Italy, was once head of his town council. Sounds like prime minister material to me. A chip off the old Silvio. He brought the bird, named Amore, to meet the pope, meaning Francis, who was taking one of his routine spins among the flock in the popemobile. Amore caught Francis’ eye, perched briefly on one of his fingers and squawked what the crowd was chanting: “Papa!” Those syllables, I’d bet, were a big improvement over other utterances Amore has learned to mimic. It’s amazing what you miss if you don’t stay on top of Vatican news these days. Did you hear about the Harley? A gift to Francis that he put his signature on but apparently never used, the motorcycle was just auctioned off for more than $275,000. Or his recent introduction to a life-size likeness of himself made out of chocolate? Pope Benedict XVI was known as “God’s Rottweiler.” Pope Francis has a dessert doppelgänger. That pretty much says it all. It was Pope John Paul II who was often called a rock star, but it’s Francis who just landed on the cover of Rolling Stone, as if he were Jagger, Springsteen or Spears. Seeing him there was like finding Mitch McConnell scowling below the logo of Tiger Beat. On my vague mental list of things that might someday come back into fashion, the papacy was never present. I used to cover it for The Times, from 2002 to 2004, and was convinced then that my beat wasn’t just a dying man — John Paul could barely walk and struggled to talk — but a dying institution, at least in the United States and much of Europe. But the bevy of bulletins from Rome and the merry nature of so many of them suggest that people everywhere, even in the more godless precincts of the Western world, can’t get enough of this new pope and are committed to giving him the benefit of the doubt. The United Nations last week issued a blistering and wholly warranted report about the Roman Catholic Church’s coddling of sexually abusive priests and its evasion of full accountability, but in none of the news coverage was Francis put on the hot seat. There was this implicit notion that the mess predated and had little to do with him, which is ridiculous: He’s been a part of this institution for a long time, and if he’d been agitating for reform and full transparency all these years, he’d never have ascended to the top. He’s no renegade. But he is the equivalent of a corporate turnaround artist or a political strategist who deftly breathes fresh life into a sputtering enterprise. I use those secular metaphors because his rehabilitation of the papacy has so much secular resonance and so many secular lessons. Like this: If you’re going to define yourself in opposition to a predecessor whom many people had misgivings about, go all the way. Francis is the Bill de Blasio to Benedict’s Michael Bloomberg, doing a complete semiotic overhaul. Less investment in festive footwear, more in the washing of other people’s feet. He’s not telling priests to stop being priests, any more than de Blasio is telling the police to stop being the police. He’s just urging them to tamp down the brusqueness and bullying. No more theological stop-and-frisk. He understands that tone trumps content — that it’s everything, really. The writer Damon Linker has contributed lively, intelligent pieces of commentary to the publications The Week and The New Republic that take Francis-fawning journalists to task for seeing a revolution that’s just not there. Linker asserts that the church, under this pope, has not in fact changed its teaching about homosexuality, the ordination of women, celibacy or any of that. And he’s absolutely correct. But he gives short shrift to what a difference a smile and a shrug make. Francis, who has mastered both, may not be telling the church’s scolds that they have to relinquish their dogma, but his manner and diction are telling everyone else that he’s not going to harangue them — that it’s neither his inclination nor his place. And that’s huge. “Who am I to judge?” he said. This, from a pope, is like Streisand saying, “Who am I to sing?” It’s a bit of self-effacement that you never saw coming. FRANCIS has also grasped that timing is everything, a point proved by the reception to his recent apostolic exhortation about the corrosive effects of greed in the world. This statement was lauded as a bold, overdue enunciation of muffled Catholic principle, but his predecessors, even Benedict in his fur-lined stole, didn’t exactly cheer the excesses of corporate titans and upbraid the underclass for being loafers hooked on government largess. Charity for the poor is as consistent a message as any the church preaches. Francis just landed his sermon at the perfect moment of welling anxiety about income inequality, and he had the additional savvy to pepper it with words and phrases at the heart of the heated political debate about what to do. Besides, he’s attentive to the coordination of message and optics. Advocating generosity toward the needy is infinitely more effective when you’ve traded the usual papal residence for a less-regal guesthouse and the customary chariot for a Ford Focus. It has a practicing-what-you-preach modesty and authenticity to it. Above all, Francis has recognized and taken advantage of the fact that people of all stripes — liberals, conservatives — are as hungry for saints as they are for, well, chocolate. They may not have much patience for the vocabulary of shame and the fustiest definitions of sin, but they want examples of goodness and calls to grace, and they’ll respond eagerly to the ones that don’t come with exclusionary rules and harping about penance. That’s part of what gave Mandela and Gandhi such currency beyond their countries. They were spiritual leaders minus the catechism. The world has no glut of these. “I believe in God, not in a Catholic God,” Francis has said, and he’s even expressed respect for atheists. When one of the stars of “Philomena” and the woman on whom it’s based visited the Vatican last week, he wasn’t put off by complaints about the movie’s anti-Catholicism or suspicion that the pair’s visit was part of an Oscar campaign. He welcomed and met with them. An ecumenical papacy, he realizes, has more sway and stamina than a narrowly, stridently pious one. It’s a big tent he’s unfurling. Parrots and porn stars welcome.",678,462,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/bruni-a-pope-you-can-eat.html,2014-02-09,A Pope You Can Eat
0,maureen,dowd,1240,article,"WASHINGTON — I OFTEN wonder what Paddy would think. I wish I could have a pastrami on wry with the late writer and satirist at the Carnegie Deli and get an exhilarating blast of truth about “the atomic, subatomic and galactic structure of things today.” What would Paddy Chayefsky make of Kim Kardashian? What would he think of Diane Sawyer showing cat videos on the ABC evening news? What would he say about Brian Williams broadcasting on the Huntley-Brinkley network a video of a pig saving a baby goat while admitting he had no idea if it was phony? (It was.) What would Paddy rant about the viral, often venomous world of the Internet, Twitter and cable news, where fake rage is all the rage all the time, bleeding over into a Congress that chooses antagonism over accomplishment, no over yes? What would he think of ominous corporate “synergy” run amok, where “news” seamlessly blends into promotion, where it’s frighteningly easy for corporate commercial interests to dictate editorial content? What would Paddy say about the Murdochization of the news, where a network slants its perspective because it sells and sells big? What would he make of former Time Inc. Editor-in-Chief Norman Pearlstine returning in a new position as Time Inc.’s chief content officer, breaking the firewall between editorial and business as he works “with business and edit teams to drive the development of new content experiences and products throughout our portfolio that will fuel future revenue growth,” as C.E.O. Joe Ripp put it? What would Paddy think of American corporations skipping out on taxes by earning nearly half of their profits in tax-haven countries? What would he think of the unholy alliance between Internet giants like Google and Facebook and the U.S. national security apparatus? Chayefsky’s dazzling satire “Network,” with its unforgettable mad prophet of the airwaves, Howard Beale, blossomed from the writer’s curdled feelings about TV. What wouldn’t the network suits do for ratings, he would ask lunch companions like Mel Brooks and Bob Fosse at the Carnegie Deli. But now America runs on clicks. Chayefsky’s nightmare has been multiplied many times over, with the total media-ization and monetization of everything, the supremacy of ratings and market share, the commercialization of all editorial decisions. Now that they’re armed with big data and science, corporate bosses are able to figure out how many people are watching which minute of which segment. An analytics service called Chartbeat gives webmasters instantaneous access to those on the other side of the screen by providing real-time data on their mouse clicks, time spent reading or watching, and even their location. In his fun upcoming book, “Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies,” Dave Itzkoff, a culture reporter at The Times, offers a vivid portrait of the charming and depressed curmudgeon. Itzkoff has great anecdotes about Faye Dunaway’s prima donna paranoia about the most brilliant love-work sex scene in movie history. And he dishes up fun factoids, like how Howard Beale got his name from the mother-daughter duo, “Big Edie” and “Little Edie” Beale, and how Peter Finch flubbed and added an extra “as” to one of the most famous lines in movie history, which Chayefsky wrote this way: “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more.” The Bronx-born writer, who died of cancer in 1981, was bedraggled and “built like an office safe,” as the director Joshua Logan put it. He did exhaustive research into networks in New York, but then had to film the movie at a Toronto TV station once the American networks realized the piece was a Strangelovey dirge. Chayefsky said his 1976 masterpiece was “a rage against the dehumanization of people” addicted to “boredom-killing” devices — a dehumanization that has gone to warp speed as we have entered the cloud. He said it was about “how to protect ourselves” from “the illusion we sell as truth.” That illusion is ever more pervasive as people believe and spread wacky viral content like snow-covered Pyramids, a half-toilet in Sochi and a story about Samsung paying Apple a billion-dollar fine in nickels. Chayefsky warned against “comicalizing the news,” noting “To make a gag out of the news is disreputable and extremely destructive.” But real news became so diminished that young people turned to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to learn about what was going on in the world. Colbert told Itzkoff that “Network” is his favorite movie. Although Howard Beale is not an inspiration for his bombastic TV alter ego, Colbert said that the Beale character anticipated an attitude those types of broadcasters share, which is “I will tell you what to think.” Beale’s approach, the comic said, was more “quasi-benevolent,” as in “I’m going to remind you that you’re being anesthetized right now.” If Paddy, who used to say “truth is truth,” could see how far beyond “Network” we’ve gone, he would not only be mad as hell. He’d be scared as hell.",2368,1923,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/dowd-still-mad-as-hell.html,2014-02-09,Still Mad as Hell
0,kate,murphy,50,article,"Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist and professor at City College of New York. When not trying to complete Einstein’s theory of everything, he writes books that explain physics and how developments in the field will shape the future. READING For bedtime reading, I usually curl up with a good monograph on quantum physics or string theory, my specialty. But since I was a child, I have been fascinated by science fiction. My all-time favorite is “The Foundation Trilogy,” by Isaac Asimov. It forces you to look 50,000 years into the future when new laws of physics may be unraveled. A lot of times physicists say that’s not possible, but that’s within our present framework, where we have limited energy and can bend space and time only to a certain degree. One of the most intriguing things I’ve read lately was by Miguel Nicolelis, called “Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains With Machines,” in which he describes hooking up the brain directly to a computer, which allows you to mentally control a robot or exoskeleton on the other side of the earth. LISTENING I am a futurist, projecting trends in science into the next decades and century, but ironically my two daughters — one is a neuroscientist and the other is a pastry chef — tell me that my taste in music is positively prehistoric. My pet theory is that the music we danced to at the height of puberty is the music that stays with us for a lifetime. For me, that means the ancient music of the Beatles, Beach Boys and Rolling Stones. WATCHING I confess I sometimes sneak a peek at “The Big Bang Theory.” I chuckle at their antics. But I cringe when they portray physicists as clueless nerds who are doormats when it comes to picking up women. There’s always a kernel of truth in stereotypes, though we don’t like to admit it. But you will find lady’s men among physicists. One of the greatest quantum physicists of all time, Erwin Schrödinger, had a diary where he listed all his conquests. He had a code for what happened to all his affairs — did it break up amicably or whether jealousy was involved, etc. FOLLOWING Livescience.com and Sciencedaily.com.

0,jenna,wortham,146,article,"ONE of my earliest memories is of sitting in an idling car with my mom and sister outside a convenience store in Virginia. Dad’s inside, buying cigarettes and scratch-off lottery tickets. Suddenly, a wild-eyed man appears at the driver-side window, yelling about white women and black men and how they don’t belong together. My mother goes feral, blocking his access to us. My father runs out, furious and swearing, before driving us away. I don’t remember what happened next, just a confusing and searing shame about the ugliness that the sight of my family could provoke. I hadn’t thought about that in years. But it bubbled up last spring in response to the vitriolic reactions to a Cheerios commercial showing a family that echoed my own: black dad, white mom, mocha-skinned little girl with soft curly hair. The commercial was uploaded to YouTube, where it provoked such foul, overtly racist reactions that General Mills, the maker of Cheerios, decided to delete all of the comments. The memory bubbled up once again last weekend when the same family appeared in a second Cheerios commercial, just as mild and sweet-tempered, shown during the Super Bowl. That one, too, drew online criticism, if not as intense. Sticks and stones, the saying goes, especially on the Internet. But the outpouring of disgust about an innocuous 30-second marketing spot may signal something deeper at work, a denial of the reality that the face of our nation is changing, and fast. According to a 2012 Census Bureau report, mixed-race Americans, while still a small minority, are one of the fastest-growing demographic groups in the country, driven by immigration and an uptick in intermarriage. Yet while there are some very public examples of seemingly stable mixed-race families — the de Blasios of New York or even Kim, Kanye and sweet baby Nori come to mind — they are remarkably absent from our screens. (Our biracial president does get his share of screen time, of course.) It’s true that multiracial characters have become more abundant on television and in the movies, even if their relationships are typically played for melodrama or broad humor, like in “Anchorman 2” or “The Best Man Holiday.” (Television shows like “Sleepy Hollow” and “Almost Human” are helping right that imbalance some.) But it is far rarer to see them portrayed as part of a dynamic family structure raising children and going about their daily lives. Olivia Pope and President Fitzgerald Grant, for example, the hot interracial couple on the popular ABC drama “Scandal,” are caught up with figuring out the intricacies of their affair, not wrangling with uncomfortable mix-ups at the grocery store or talking their child through the alienation that can come with figuring out where and how to fit in. There are a few exceptions, like “The Fosters” on ABC Family and the Showtime series “The L Word,” but not many. Television is still both a barometer of social change and an evolutionary force that can help change cultural attitudes. So it’s hard not to wonder whether the simple lack of depictions of normal, mixed-race families and well-adjusted biracial offspring in popular culture is in part responsible for the reaction to the Cheerios commercials. Social media, which erects a two-way mirror into regular lives, also has the power to transform what was once alien and uncomfortable into normal and routine. There are enough online outposts, from photographs on Facebook to Instagram, that can show a variety of diverse families and offer some measure of hope. But still. Growing up in the early 1990s, when I fell into my mother’s lap, crying over being called names like “oreo,” “zebra baby” or worse, my mother would hug me and say that someday, everyone will be a little bit of everything, and no one will be able to tease anyone ever again. I’m still hoping she’s right about that. Last weekend, I settled down to watch the Super Bowl with a group of friends, some of whom were also mixed race. The room fell quiet as the Cheerios ad came on the screen. I held my breath, checked Twitter — the initial responses were largely positive — and my heart soared. Despite the obvious marketing advantage General Mills hoped to leverage by running a second Cheerios spot, it was still a stirring experience to see my reality presented so positively and naturally on screen. Later we cheered for the halftime performer Bruno Mars, born in Hawaii, the product of a Filipino mother and a Puerto Rican and Jewish father, and finished our beers, spicy wings and cheese dip.  ",545,281,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/where-is-my-family-on-tv.html,2014-02-09,Where Is My Family on TV?
0,vincent,precht,265,article,"SO this is all I can remember about meeting the Beatles. A Miami chauffeur asks, “Are you here for the Beatles?” I think he’s talking about a flea circus. My grandfather Ed Sullivan is known for introducing animal acts. My brother and I are following my father down a corridor at the Deauville Beach Resort. There are porthole windows overlooking the street below. I know now that the Beatles aren’t a flea circus. I know they’re important (my father has informed me) and I’m a little nervous about meeting them. I’m only 6, after all. I think we’re heading into a dressing room when my father opens a door. It opens to a huge ballroom. Technicians are getting ready for the show my father, Robert Precht, is about to produce. It is a week after the Beatles made their debut on my grandfather’s show. This performance, set for Feb. 16, 1964, is their second appearance. Only Paul is wearing a blazer. The others are wearing white terry cloth shirts. I take note: I am wearing lace-up Keds. They are wearing sneakers without laces. I have short hair. Theirs is long, long, long — practically covering their ears! It’s sound check time. My father seats my brother and me in the audience a few rows back. The Beatles start playing “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” It’s the most beautiful thing I have ever heard. There are other things I can mention: Seeing them again at Shea Stadium the next year. “The screaming was so loud,” I’d tell my friends between playing “Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” “you couldn’t hear a thing.” Making out, a few years later, with girls who would emerge breathlessly to ask, “Did you really meet the Beatles?” Making my answer short and sweet. The biggest moment of my life came 40 years after that momentous occasion: having a son, whom we named after my grandfather. He knows about the Beatles because I drill it into him. Otherwise, he couldn’t care less. I am a public-school teacher who, in my own loopy way, is carrying on the legacy of live television that my father and grandfather helped pioneer. Recording myself getting “kettled” by riot police officers at Occupy L.A. Live-streaming protests — Diane Ravitch addressing teachers about threats to public education, a student mike-checking the school reformer Michelle Rhee — because the country seems to have lost its way and filming people protesting seems like the only thing to do. Maybe having the Beatles on his show seemed like the only thing to do, to my grandfather. The country was reeling after Oswald shot Kennedy. It needed something to sing about. It needed hope.

0,woody,allen,58251,article,"  Last Sunday, Nicholas Kristof  wrote a column about Dylan Farrow, the adopted daughter of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow. Mr. Allen has written the following response to the column and Dylan’s account. TWENTY-ONE years ago, when I first heard Mia Farrow had accused me of child molestation, I found the idea so ludicrous I didn’t give it a second thought. We were involved in a terribly acrimonious breakup, with great enmity between us and a custody battle slowly gathering energy. The self-serving transparency of her malevolence seemed so obvious I didn’t even hire a lawyer to defend myself. It was my show business attorney who told me she was bringing the accusation to the police and I would need a criminal lawyer. I naïvely thought the accusation would be dismissed out of hand because of course, I hadn’t molested Dylan and any rational person would see the ploy for what it was. Common sense would prevail. After all, I was a 56-year-old man who had never before (or after) been accused of child molestation. I had been going out with Mia for 12 years and never in that time did she ever suggest to me anything resembling misconduct. Now, suddenly, when I had driven up to her house in Connecticut one afternoon to visit the kids for a few hours, when I would be on my raging adversary’s home turf, with half a dozen people present, when I was in the blissful early stages of a happy new relationship with the woman I’d go on to marry — that I would pick this moment in time to embark on a career as a child molester should seem to the most skeptical mind highly unlikely. The sheer illogic of such a crazy scenario seemed to me dispositive. Notwithstanding, Mia insisted that I had abused Dylan and took her immediately to a doctor to be examined. Dylan told the doctor she had not been molested. Mia then took Dylan out for ice cream, and when she came back with her the child had changed her story. The police began their investigation; a possible indictment hung in the balance. I very willingly took a lie-detector test and of course passed because I had nothing to hide. I asked Mia to take one and she wouldn’t. Last week a woman named Stacey Nelkin, whom I had dated many years ago, came forward to the press to tell them that when Mia and I first had our custody battle 21 years ago, Mia had wanted her to testify that she had been underage when I was dating her, despite the fact this was untrue. Stacey refused. I include this anecdote so we all know what kind of character we are dealing with here. One can imagine in learning this why she wouldn’t take a lie-detector test. Meanwhile the Connecticut police turned for help to a special investigative unit they relied on in such cases, the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital. This group of impartial, experienced men and women whom the district attorney looked to for guidance as to whether to prosecute, spent months doing a meticulous investigation, interviewing everyone concerned, and checking every piece of evidence. Finally they wrote their conclusion which I quote here: “It is our expert opinion that Dylan was not sexually abused by Mr. Allen. Further, we believe that Dylan’s statements on videotape and her statements to us during our evaluation do not refer to actual events that occurred to her on August 4th, 1992... In developing our opinion we considered three hypotheses to explain Dylan’s statements. First, that Dylan’s statements were true and that Mr. Allen had sexually abused her; second, that Dylan’s statements were not true but were made up by an emotionally vulnerable child who was caught up in a disturbed family and who was responding to the stresses in the family; and third, that Dylan was coached or influenced by her mother, Ms. Farrow. While we can conclude that Dylan was not sexually abused, we can not be definite about whether the second formulation by itself or the third formulation by itself is true. We believe that it is more likely that a combination of these two formulations best explains Dylan’s allegations of sexual abuse.” Could it be any clearer? Mr. Allen did not abuse Dylan; most likely a vulnerable, stressed-out 7-year-old was coached by Mia Farrow. This conclusion disappointed a number of people. The district attorney was champing at the bit to prosecute a celebrity case, and Justice Elliott Wilk, the custody judge, wrote a very irresponsible opinion saying when it came to the molestation, “we will probably never know what occurred.” But we did know because it had been determined and there was no equivocation about the fact that no abuse had taken place. Justice Wilk was quite rough on me and never approved of my relationship with Soon-Yi, Mia’s adopted daughter, who was then in her early 20s. He thought of me as an older man exploiting a much younger woman, which outraged Mia as improper despite the fact she had dated a much older Frank Sinatra when she was 19. In fairness to Justice Wilk, the public felt the same dismay over Soon-Yi and myself, but despite what it looked like our feelings were authentic and we’ve been happily married for 16 years with two great kids, both adopted. (Incidentally, coming on the heels of the media circus and false accusations, Soon-Yi and I were extra carefully scrutinized by both the adoption agency and adoption courts, and everyone blessed our adoptions.) Mia took custody of the children and we went our separate ways. I was heartbroken. Moses was angry with me. Ronan I didn’t know well because Mia would never let me get close to him from the moment he was born and Dylan, whom I adored and was very close to and about whom Mia called my sister in a rage and said, “He took my daughter, now I’ll take his.” I never saw her again nor was I able to speak with her no matter how hard I tried. I still loved her deeply, and felt guilty that by falling in love with Soon-Yi I had put her in the position of being used as a pawn for revenge. Soon-Yi and I made countless attempts to see Dylan but Mia blocked them all, spitefully knowing how much we both loved her but totally indifferent to the pain and damage she was causing the little girl merely to appease her own vindictiveness. Here I quote Moses Farrow, 14 at the time: “My mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister.” Moses is now 36 years old and a family therapist by profession. “Of course Woody did not molest my sister,” he said. “She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him.” Dylan was 7, Ronan 4, and this was, according to Moses, the steady narrative year after year. I pause here for a quick word on the Ronan situation. Is he my son or, as Mia suggests, Frank Sinatra’s? Granted, he looks a lot like Frank with the blue eyes and facial features, but if so what does this say? That all during the custody hearing Mia lied under oath and falsely represented Ronan as our son? Even if he is not Frank’s, the possibility she raises that he could be, indicates she was secretly intimate with him during our years. Not to mention all the money I paid for child support. Was I supporting Frank’s son? Again, I want to call attention to the integrity and honesty of a person who conducts her life like that. NOW it’s 21 years later and Dylan has come forward with the accusations that the Yale experts investigated and found false. Plus a few little added creative flourishes that seem to have magically appeared during our 21-year estrangement. Not that I doubt Dylan hasn’t come to believe she’s been molested, but if from the age of 7 a vulnerable child is taught by a strong mother to hate her father because he is a monster who abused her, is it so inconceivable that after many years of this indoctrination the image of me Mia wanted to establish had taken root? Is it any wonder the experts at Yale had picked up the maternal coaching aspect 21 years ago? Even the venue where the fabricated molestation was supposed to have taken place was poorly chosen but interesting. Mia chose the attic of her country house, a place she should have realized I’d never go to because it is a tiny, cramped, enclosed spot where one can hardly stand up and I’m a major claustrophobe. The one or two times she asked me to come in there to look at something, I did, but quickly had to run out. Undoubtedly the attic idea came to her from the Dory Previn song, “With My Daddy in the Attic.” It was on the same record as the song Dory Previn had written about Mia’s betraying their friendship by insidiously stealing her husband, André, “Beware of Young Girls.” One must ask, did Dylan even write the letter or was it at least guided by her mother? Does the letter really benefit Dylan or does it simply advance her mother’s shabby agenda? That is to hurt me with a smear. There is even a lame attempt to do professional damage by trying to involve movie stars, which smells a lot more like Mia than Dylan. After all, if speaking out was really a necessity for Dylan, she had already spoken out months earlier in Vanity Fair. Here I quote Moses Farrow again: “Knowing that my mother often used us as pawns, I cannot trust anything that is said or written from anyone in the family.” Finally, does Mia herself really even believe I molested her daughter? Common sense must ask: Would a mother who thought her 7-year-old daughter was sexually abused by a molester (a pretty horrific crime), give consent for a film clip of her to be used to honor the molester at the Golden Globes? Of course, I did not molest Dylan. I loved her and hope one day she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter’s well-being. Being taught to hate your father and made to believe he molested you has already taken a psychological toll on this lovely young woman, and Soon-Yi and I are both hoping that one day she will understand who has really made her a victim and reconnect with us, as Moses has, in a loving, productive way. No one wants to discourage abuse victims from speaking out, but one must bear in mind that sometimes there are people who are falsely accused and that is also a terribly destructive thing. (This piece will be my final word on this entire matter and no one will be responding on my behalf to any further comments on it by any party. Enough people have been hurt.)",36976,16480,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html,2014-02-09,Woody Allen Speaks Out
0,vanessa,bohns,113,article,"WHAT is the chance that you could get someone to lie for you? What about vandalizing public property at your suggestion? Most of us assume that others would go along with such schemes only if, on some level, they felt comfortable doing so. If not, they’d simply say “no,” right? Yet research suggests that saying “no” can be more difficult than we believe — and that we have more power over others’ decisions than we think. Social psychologists have spent decades demonstrating how difficult it can be to say “no” to other people’s propositions, even when they are morally questionable — consider Stanley Milgram’s infamous experiments, in which participants were persuaded to administer what they believed to be dangerous electric shocks to a fellow participant. Countless studies have subsequently shown that we find it similarly difficult to resist social pressure from peers, friends and colleagues. Our decisions regarding everything from whether to turn the lights off when we leave a room to whether to call in sick to take a day off from work are affected by the actions and opinions of our neighbors and colleagues. But what about those times when we are the ones trying to get someone to act unethically? Do we realize how much power we wield with a simple request, suggestion or dare? New research by my students and me suggests that we don’t. We examined this question in a series of studies in which we had participants ask strangers to perform unethical acts. Before making their requests, participants predicted how many people they thought would comply. In one study, 25 college students asked 108 unfamiliar students to vandalize a library book. Targets who complied wrote the word “pickle” in pen on one of the pages. As in the Milgram studies, many of the targets protested. They asked the instigators to take full responsibility for any repercussions. Yet, despite their hesitation, a large portion still complied. Most important for our research question, more targets complied than participants had anticipated. Our participants predicted that an average of 28.5 percent would go along. In fact, fully half of those who were approached agreed. Moreover, 87 percent of participants underestimated the number they would be able to persuade to vandalize the book. In another study, we asked 155 participants to think about a series of ethical dilemmas — for example, calling in sick to work to attend a baseball game. One group was told to think about these misdeeds from the perspective of a person deciding whether to commit them, and to imagine receiving advice from a colleague suggesting they do it or not. Another group took the opposite side, and thought about them from the perspective of someone advising another person about whether or not to do each deed. Those in the first group were strongly influenced by the advice they received. When they were urged to engage in the misdeed, they said they would be more comfortable doing so than when they were advised not to. Their average reported comfort level fell around the midpoint of a 7-point scale after receiving unethical advice, but fell closer to the low end after receiving ethical advice. However, participants in the “advisory” role thought that their opinions would hold little sway over the other person’s decision, assuming that participants in the first group would feel equally comfortable regardless of whether they had received unethical or ethical advice. Taken together, our research, which was recently published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, suggests that we often fail to recognize the power of social pressure when we are the ones doing the pressuring. Notably, this tendency may be especially pronounced in cultures like the United States’, where independence is so highly valued. American culture idolizes individuals who stand up to peer pressure. But that doesn’t mean that most do; in fact, such idolatry may hide, and thus facilitate, compliance under social pressure, especially when we are the ones putting on the pressure. Consider the roles in the Milgram experiments: Most people have probably fantasized about being one of the subjects and standing up to the pressure. But in daily life, we play the role of the metaphorical experimenter in those studies as often as we play the participant. We bully. We pressure others to blow off work to come out for a drink or stiff a waitress who is having a bad night. These suggestions are not always wrong or unethical, but they may impact others’ behaviors more than we realize. If we do not recognize the extent to which our suggestions and actions are likely to affect others’ behavior, we may be careless about the things we say and do. On the other hand, we may fail to speak up for what we think is right.",289,285,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/would-i-lie-for-you.html,2014-02-09,Would You Lie for Me?
0,porter,fox,13138,article,"OVER the next two weeks, hundreds of millions of people will watch Americans like Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin ski for gold on the downhill alpine course. Television crews will pan across epic vistas of the rugged Caucasus Mountains, draped with brilliant white ski slopes. What viewers might not see is the 16 million cubic feet of snow that was stored under insulated blankets last year to make sure those slopes remained white, or the hundreds of snow-making guns that have been running around the clock to keep them that way. Officials canceled two Olympic test events last February in Sochi after several days of temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a lack of snowfall had left ski trails bare and brown in spots. That situation led the climatologist Daniel Scott, a professor of global change and tourism at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, to analyze potential venues for future Winter Games. His thought was that with a rise in the average global temperature of more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit possible by 2100, there might not be that many snowy regions left in which to hold the Games. He concluded that of the 19 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics, as few as 10 might be cold enough by midcentury to host them again. By 2100, that number shrinks to 6. The planet has warmed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1800s, and as a result, snow is melting. In the last 47 years, a million square miles of spring snow cover has disappeared from the Northern Hemisphere. Europe has lost half of its Alpine glacial ice since the 1850s, and if climate change is not reined in, two-thirds of European ski resorts will be likely to close by 2100. The same could happen in the United States, where in the Northeast, more than half of the 103 ski resorts may no longer be viable in 30 years because of warmer winters. As far for the Western part of the country, it will lose an estimated 25 to 100 percent of its snowpack by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailed — reducing the snowpack in Park City, Utah, to zero and relegating skiing to the top quarter of Ajax Mountain in Aspen. The facts are straightforward: The planet is getting hotter. Snow melts above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The Alps are warming two to three times faster than the worldwide average, possibly because of global circulation patterns. Since 1970, the rate of winter warming per decade in the United States has been triple the rate of the previous 75 years, with the strongest trends in the Northern regions of the country. Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, and this winter is already looking to be one of the driest on record — with California at just 12 percent of its average snowpack in January, and the Pacific Northwest at around 50 percent. To a skier, snowboarder or anyone who has spent time in the mountains, the idea of brown peaks in midwinter is surreal. Poets write of the grace and beauty by which snowflakes descend and transform a landscape. Powder hounds follow the 100-odd storms that track across the United States every winter, then drive for hours to float down a mountainside in the waist-deep “cold smoke” that the storms leave behind. The snow I learned to ski on in northern Maine was more blue than white, and usually spewed from snow-making guns instead of the sky. I didn’t like skiing at first. It was cold. And uncomfortable. Then, when I was 12, the mystical confluence of vectors that constitute a ski turn aligned, and I was hooked. I scrubbed toilets at my father’s boatyard on Mount Desert Island in high school so I could afford a ski pass and sold season passes in college at Mad River Glen in Vermont to get a free pass for myself. After graduating, I moved to Jackson Hole, Wyo., for the skiing. Four years later, Powder magazine hired me, and I’ve been an editor there ever since. My bosses were generous enough to send me to five continents over the last 15 years, with skis in tow. I’ve skied the lightest snow on earth on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, where icy fronts spin off the Siberian plains and dump 10 feet of powder in a matter of days. In the high peaks of Bulgaria and Morocco, I slid through snow stained pink by grains of Saharan sand that the crystals formed around. In Baja, Mexico, I skied a sliver of hardpack snow at 10,000 feet on Picacho del Diablo, sandwiched between the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific Ocean. A few years later, a crew of skiers and I journeyed to the whipsaw Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey to ski steep couloirs alongside caves where troglodytes lived thousands of years ago. At every range I traveled to, I noticed a brotherhood among mountain folk: Say you’re headed into the hills, and the doors open. So it has been a surprise to see the winter sports community, as one of the first populations to witness effects of climate change in its own backyard, not reacting more vigorously and swiftly to reverse the fate we are writing for ourselves. It’s easy to blame the big oil companies and the billions of dollars they spend on influencing the media and popular opinion. But the real reason is a lack of knowledge. I know, because I, too, was ignorant until I began researching the issue for a book on the future of snow. I was floored by how much snow had already disappeared from the planet, not to mention how much was predicted to melt in my lifetime. The ski season in parts of British Columbia is four to five weeks shorter than it was 50 years ago, and in eastern Canada, the season is predicted to drop to less than two months by midcentury. At Lake Tahoe, spring now arrives two and a half weeks earlier, and some computer models predict that the Pacific Northwest will receive 40 to 70 percent less snow by 2050. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise — they grew 41 percent between 1990 and 2008 — then snowfall, winter and skiing will no longer exist as we know them by the end of the century. The effect on the ski industry has already been significant. Between 1999 and 2010, low snowfall years cost the industry $1 billion and up to 27,000 jobs. Oregon took the biggest hit out West, with 31 percent fewer skier visits during low snow years. Next was Washington at 28 percent, Utah at 14 percent and Colorado at 7.7 percent. The winter sports industry contributes $66 billion annually to the nation’s economy, and supports more than 960,000 jobs across 38 states, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. A surprisingly large sector of the United States economy appears to be teetering on the brink. Much of these environmental data come from a 2012 report, “Climate Impacts on the Winter Tourism Economy in the United States,” by two University of New Hampshire researchers, Elizabeth Burakowski and Matthew Magnusson. The paper was commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council and a start-up advocacy group called Protect Our Winters. The professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones started that group, known as POW, in 2007 when he realized that many of the slopes he had once ridden no longer held snow. It has since become the leading voice for those fighting to save winter, largely because few others are doing anything about it. The National Ski Area Association has reacted with relatively ineffective campaigns like Sustainable Slopes and the Climate Challenge, while policies at ski resorts range from aggressively green to indifferent. Somewhere in between lie the majority of American ski areas, which are struggling to make ends meet while pushing recycling, car-pooling, carbon offsets and awareness campaigns to show they care. The truth is, it is too late for all of that. Greening the ski industry is commendable, but it isn’t nearly enough. Nothing besides a national policy shift on how we create and consume energy will keep our mountains white in the winter — and slow global warming to a safe level. This is no longer a scientific debate. It is scientific fact. The greatest fear of most climate scientists is continued complacency that leads to a series of natural climatic feedbacks — like the melting of the methane-rich permafrost of Arctic Canada. Artificial snow-making now helps to cover 88 percent of American ski resorts, and has become the stopgap measure to defend against the early effects of climate change. Snow-making requires a tremendous amount of electricity and water, though, so it’s unlikely that snow guns will be our savior. In the Alps, snow-making uses more water in the winter than the entire city of Vienna, about 500,000 gallons of water per acre. Ski areas like Vail, Keystone, Breckenridge and Arapahoe Basin seed clouds with silver iodide to make it snow, but that won’t help much when it gets warmer. When it does, whatever the clouds bring will fall as rain. With several dry winters back to back, the ski industry is waking up. Last spring, 108 ski resorts, along with 40 major companies, signed the Climate Declaration, urging federal policy makers to take action on climate change. A few weeks later, President Obama announced his Climate Action Plan, stating, “Mountain communities worry about what smaller snowpacks will mean for tourism — and then, families at the bottom of the mountains wonder what it will mean for their drinking water.” It was a big step forward for skiers and the country. And it led people to ask me, “Why save skiing when there are more pressing consequences of climate change to worry about?” The answer is, this is not about skiing. It is about snow, a vital component of earth’s climate system and water cycle. When it disappears, what follows is a dangerous chain reaction of catastrophes like forest fires, drought, mountain pine beetle infestation, degraded river habitat, loss of hydroelectric power, dried-up aquifers and shifting weather patterns. Not to mention that more than a billion people around the world — including about 70 million in the western United States — rely on snowmelt for their fresh water supply. I remember watching my first Winter Olympics in 1980. We were on a family ski trip at Copper Mountain in Colorado, where my brother and I skied the first powder run of our lives. It was on a gentle slope just off one of the main trails. We wiggled down the hill in chaotic rapture then skied the run again and again. The snow was soft and the turns effortless. You don’t have to be a skier to feel nostalgia for those whitewashed days — or to see the writing on the wall.",22788,10183,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/opinion/sunday/the-end-of-snow.html,2014-02-08,The End of Snow?
0,,,33,article,"The slaughter of the African elephant continues. Nearly 100 of these majestic animals are sacrificed every day for ivory trinkets — bracelets, statuettes and other baubles sold illegally around the world. Wildlife experts estimate the remaining African elephant population at 350,000 to 500,000, with poachers targeting 30,000 to 35,000 a year. Elizabeth Bennett of the Wildlife Conservation Society estimates that one subspecies, the African forest elephant, could become extinct in the next decade. A few governments have begun destroying illegal ivory as a warning to poachers and traffickers. The United States crushed six tons of illegal tusks, jewelry and other items in November. France pulverized three tons of illegal ivory this week. Even China, the main destination for illicit ivory, which sells for as much as $1,000 a pound on the streets of Beijing, has begun to act, destroying six tons last month. New York State Assemblyman Robert Sweeney wants to prohibit all ivory sales in the state, including those that are now technically legal. Even though trafficking in African elephant ivory was outlawed worldwide in 1989 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, there are exemptions for ivory from elephants killed before 1989 to make allowances for antiques like scrimshaw, piano keys and older works of art. The problem is determining when an animal has been killed; even expensive radioactive tests can’t always get it right. Further, as Jim Dwyer recently wrote in The Times, ivory can be stained to look dark and old. And very often appraisers simply take the seller’s word that the ivory qualifies for an exemption. Mr. Sweeney, the chairman of the Assembly’s Committee on Environmental Conservation, offers a straightforward answer: State authorities, he says, should ban the sale of ivory altogether until African elephants get “the protections they need.” Mr. Sweeney notes further that the penalties for selling ivory illegally are minimal, and federal and state wildlife authorities are often overwhelmed. New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation is charged with issuing licenses to sell ivory, but Mr. Sweeney has said it is not being tough enough and often fails to challenge appraisals and sellers’ documents rigorously. The department, he says, must simply stop issuing permits until there are ways to slow the killing. Little else seems to be working. The 1989 agreement slowed the killing for a while, but the black market for “white gold” is booming again, as demand in Asia has increased along with the rise in disposable income. A United Nations report in September noted that there have been mass slaughters of elephants by well-organized criminal gangs. Mr. Sweeney cannot solve a global problem. But he and his fellow legislators can make a strong statement that until elephants in Africa are spared, New York’s freewheeling ivory market, one of the largest in the country, is closed.",235,197,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/opinion/the-bloody-ivory-business.html,2014-02-08,The Bloody Ivory Business
0,,,6,article,"In recent years developing countries like Brazil complained that the United States and other industrialized countries were waging a “currency war” against them by artificially driving down the value of dollars, euros and yen. Now officials in some nations, like Argentina and Turkey, are blaming foreign “vultures” and “the interest rate lobby” for the sharp depreciation of their currencies. Policy makers fear any big and sudden changes in the value of their currencies. A rapid appreciation makes their country’s exports less competitive on the world market, while a fast depreciation raises the cost of imported commodities like oil and makes it harder for governments to repay loans they took out in dollars or euros. So it should come as no surprise that officials are upset by the recent market movements. But their anger is misplaced. There is no foreign conspiracy against the Argentine peso, the Turkish lira or other currencies that have fallen against the dollar. The Federal Reserve’s recent decisions to slow its bond-buying program have strengthened the dollar. But most of these currencies have declined primarily because of domestic problems. For example, the Argentina peso has been under pressure for months because misguided government policies caused inflation to surge to 28 percent last year. The peso has fallen nearly 22 percent against the dollar since the end of November. The Turkish lira has fallen about 9 percent in the same period because Turkey’s central bank has been too slow to raise interest rates despite an annual inflation rate of 7.4 percent. And investors have been unnerved by the autocratic style of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has tried to squash corruption investigations of senior officials. What leaders of developing countries ought to be doing now is addressing economic problems like inflation and corruption while investing in infrastructure and education. Going forward, emerging markets could better protect themselves from the rapid flow of foreign capital into and out of their financial systems by regulating them. Unfortunately, many countries, including India and Turkey, made themselves more dependent on speculative foreign capital flows in recent years, according to the economists Dani Rodrik and Arvind Subramanian. That has made their economies more vulnerable to sudden changes in the sentiments of investors. Blaming the Fed is particularly misguided.

0,,,31,article,"New York City stands at the epicenter of an affordable housing crisis that has placed poor and elderly people throughout the country at greater risk of homelessness and forced low-income renters to forgo food and medical care to stay in their homes. Over the last several decades, New York mayors have tried to combat this problem by renovating rundown buildings that otherwise would have been torn down, subsidizing rents and construction costs for affordable housing and giving developers incentives to include affordable units in new buildings. The efforts have created hundreds of thousands of apartments that are affordable to low- and moderate-income families. Even so, the affordable housing gap appears to be growing. Mayor Bill de Blasio has promised to build or preserve 200,000 units in the next decade — about 35,000 more than the Bloomberg administration achieved over 12 years. He has proposed steering city pension funds into affordable housing construction, raising taxes on vacant land to spur construction and legalizing tens of thousands of currently illegal basement apartments. His most aggressive proposal would require developers to set aside units for low- and moderate-income families in major projects. Many cities around the country have various forms of inclusionary zoning laws. While this is a worthy approach, New York courts have been less sympathetic than courts in other states to attempts by local governments to regulate housing creation. Legal issues aside, excessively rigid laws might have the effect of discouraging development. Housing experts have found that programs with greater flexibility — offering off-site options, and incentives rather than mandatory participation — may produce more units. The mayor needs to work with builders to find mutually beneficial solutions, particularly outside Manhattan. One big hurdle to more development is the state property tax on rental property, which discourages housing development by saddling the city’s rental buildings with some of the highest tax burdens in the nation. The Legislature should remove this disincentive. The city needs to put more money into the capital budget for affordable housing. It must also rethink how it uses policy tools, including subsidies, taxes and zoning rules. (For example, builders drawing on two or three subsidy programs can’t be allowed to double dip without actually producing more units.) And the city should explore ways to make apartments permanently affordable, rather than letting rent limits expire after a period. Mr. de Blasio and Alicia Glen, his newly appointed deputy mayor for housing and economic development, also need to be perfectly frank about the economics that make affordable housing production possible. Communities around the city would prefer affordable housing in small, three- or four-unit buildings. But with land and building costs soaring, the most cost-effective approach is to build moderate-size, mixed-income buildings in which a portion of the apartments are set aside for low- and moderate-income families. The problem, however, is that local communities — even those that desperately need housing — tend to view larger, mixed-income developments as part of a gentrification process that will drive them out. The deteriorating condition of public housing is another huge problem. The New York City Housing Authority, which manages more than 178,000 apartments in 334 developments spread around the city, faces a $6 billion backlog in capital repairs, mainly because of federal cuts. In December, The Times reported that hundreds of apartments had been left vacant, some of them for years on end, awaiting major repairs. Given that federal aid for public housing is unlikely to come back, the city needs to find alternative sources of revenue. Mr. de Blasio should seriously consider a plan, proposed by the Bloomberg administration, that would lease open space in the public housing projects to developers who would build mixed-income apartments that would generate $30 million to $50 million a year to be used to meet the system’s capital needs. Under that plan, 20 percent of the units in the new buildings would be permanently set aside for low-income families. Some residents fear that such development would be a prelude to driving them out. Without new revenue, though, housing authority buildings will continue to deteriorate. The affordable housing shortage represents an enormous challenge. But with energy and some ingenuity, the new administration could make a dent in this problem.",93,115,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/opinion/new-yorks-affordable-housing-shortage.html,2014-02-08,New York’s Affordable Housing Shortage
0,charles,blow,722,article,"The Republican messaging machine is at it again, cranking out scurrilous memes that defame the president and distract from the party’s inaction. The latest talking point is that the president is a “lawless” “dictator” hellbent on operating outside, and indeed above, the law. This is not a particularly new line of attack. Conservatives have been using some variation of the lawlessness theme for some time to refer to the president’s actions, particularly to the administration’s adjustments to the Affordable Care Act. But the distillation and repetition of the word “lawless” gathered new steam last month when the president signaled that he would work with Congress where he could but would issue executive orders, to the extent that he could, when he was stymied by Congress. Before a cabinet meeting, the president said, “One of the things that I will be emphasizing in this meeting is the fact that we are not going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we are providing Americans the kind of help that they need.” He added, “I’ve got a pen, and I’ve got a phone.” Before the president could even repeat the sentiment in his State of the Union speech, Republicans were up in arms. Representative Tim Huelskamp tweeted that night, “1st Release of Obama speech reads like the dictates from a King. All orders he will do to bypass Congress #LawLess.” Huelskamp went on to repeat the #LawLess hashtag throughout the night, and it was picked up by others. After the speech, Michele Bachmann threatened to sue the “king,” Obama. It seems to matter not that this president has in no way been an abuser of executive orders. Quite the opposite. According to the American Presidency Project, a collaboration between John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters at the University of California, Santa Barbara, President Obama had issued only 168 executive orders as of Jan. 20, fewer than any two-term president in more than 100 years. Still, the “lawless” messaging has only picked up steam. On Sunday, Paul Ryan, appearing on the ABC News show “This Week,” said: “It’s not the number of executive orders, it’s the scope of the executive orders. It’s the fact that he’s actually contradicting law, like in the health care case, or proposing new laws without going through Congress.” Ryan continued, “We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing policies and new laws without going through Congress. Presidents don’t write laws, Congress does.” The Republican senator and likely presidential candidate Ted Cruz told Glenn Beck on Tuesday that “there is a pattern of lawlessness in this administration that is breathtaking.” The latest application of the lawlessness meme has emerged on the immigration debate. On Thursday, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, expressed his opposition to immigration reform in a statement, saying that “the administration’s aggressive defiance of congressionally enacted law is a profound obstacle in the way of any proposed immigration changes.” He continued, “President Obama must end the immigration lawlessness.” Also on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner signaled that he might be caving on pushing immigration this year, saying in part: “Listen, there’s widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws. It’s going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes.” It is a particularly tortured construct: Congress won’t make laws for fear the president won’t respect them. Even the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page wasn’t buying that one, as it chided the House G.O.P. for its “fear of a talk-radio backlash” in not moving forward even on immigration proposals that most Republicans support. This lawlessness talk is simply another iteration of the “othering” of this president. Paint him as a criminal, an enemy to the rule of law, and by extension, to the construct of America. America is, after all, a nation of laws. It’s another excuse for Republican obstruction and recalcitrance. It’s another line of attack that will allow Republicans to bide their time and hope for 2014 to deliver them the Senate and 2016 to deliver them the White House. They are banking on wearing down the truth, and this president, through what has become their bailiwick: repetition of fallacy.",500,651,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/opinion/blow-a-pen-a-phone-and-a-meme.html,2014-02-08,"A Pen, a Phone and a Meme"
0,gail,collins,185,article,"House Speaker John Boehner has his good moments. For instance, I always enjoy it when he brushes off a question by saying: “If ands and buts were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas.” Also, there was the time he dressed down one of his members, Steve King of Iowa, for describing Dreamers — young people who were illegally brought into the country when they were children — as a generation of drug mules. (“... and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.”) Plus, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas says that when he thanked Boehner for standing up to King, Boehner responded. “What an ass.” I’m editing, but you get the idea. So, a lot to appreciate when it comes to Boehner on the subject of the great melting pot. Until Thursday, when the speaker pretty much tossed the idea of immigration reform over a railing. This was a metaphorical railing and not the one that the congressman from Staten Island threatened to throw a reporter over. But it’s sad. The immigration bill that was passed by the Senate last year would have done a lot of good, both in giving millions of undocumented residents a better life and in rationalizing the way we decide who gets to come here legally and who doesn’t. For a while it looked as if the House was going to pass a modest version of the same. But that was long ago. Back, um, last week. That was when the Republicans came up with a series of principles for reform during a group retreat. Principles that, Boehner said, “our members by and large support, put together by the leadership team. And they believe it.” He made that last comment Thursday, about three seconds before he announced that nothing was going to happen. Pop Quiz. Complete the following sentence: John Boehner dropped the plan to pass immigration reform in 2014, and blamed his sudden, abrupt, U-turn on: A) The people who closed down the George Washington Bridge without Gov. Chris Christie ever knowing a single thing about it. B) Russian oligarchs. C) Justin Bieber. D) President Obama. Yes! Everybody got this one right! John Boehner says the House Republicans won’t pass the plan they came up with last week because Barack Obama ruined everything. “Listen, there’s widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws,” he told a press conference. “And it’s going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes.” Let us consider the Obama administration’s record on enforcing immigration laws. Under this president, half of all federal crime prosecution involves immigration crime. The government now spends more on enforcing immigration laws than it spends on the F.B.I., Drug Enforcement Administration, Secret Service, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives combined. We have more than 650 miles of fencing along the Mexican border. Plus, don’t forget all the drones. And 21,391 border patrol agents. Given the plummeting numbers of people actually trying to illegally cross into the country, let us hope that a lot of those agents are good at meditation. A sizable chunk of Obama’s own base is furious over the all-time high rate of deportations — nearly two million so far in his tenure and way ahead of the record of George W. Bush. The government now automatically goes through the fingerprints of people who are arrested and sifts out the ones who are here illegally. Immigrant advocates say the system breaks up families and viciously punishes people who may be guilty of nothing more than a minor traffic violation. The administration says it’s all about targeting the real criminals. This is an argument we need to continue, but, however it turns out, the answer is not going to be that Barack Obama refused to enforce the immigration laws. So what do you think John Boehner’s real motive is for dropping immigration reform? Do you think his members are worried that if illegal immigrants get a path to citizenship, they’ll use their franchise to vote Democratic? (“G.O.P. Crafts Plan to Wreck the Country, Lose Voters,” said the headline in a blog from the ever-popular Ann Coulter.) Maybe the House is just short of time. There’s a post office somewhere that needs renaming, and Obamacare to repeal. “Well, we got a lot of things on our plate,” said Boehner. He mentioned fixing Medicare payments for doctors and flood insurance. That’s one heck of an agenda, but maybe they could fit in just a little more by expanding their 2014 schedule beyond the current 97 more working days. Too hypothetical. Press Boehner on that one and he’ll feel obliged to tell you about candy and nuts again.",227,448,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/opinion/collins-boehner-on-fantasy-island.html,2014-02-08,Boehner on Fantasy Island
0,mehrsa,baradaran,479,article,"ATHENS, Ga. — PEOPLE like to complain about banks popping up like Starbucks on every corner these days. But in poor neighborhoods, the phenomenon is quite the opposite: Over the past couple of decades, the banks have pulled out. Approximately 88 million people in the United States, or 28 percent of the population, have no bank account at all, or do have a bank account, but primarily rely on check-cashing storefronts, payday lenders, title lenders, or even pawnshops to meet their financial needs. And these lenders charge much more for their services than traditional banks. The average annual income for an “unbanked” family is $25,500, and about 10 percent of that income, or $2,412, goes to fees and interest for gaining access to credit or other financial services. But a possible solution has appeared, in the unlikely guise of the United States Postal Service. The unwieldy institution, which has essentially been self-funded since 1971, and has maxed out its $15 billion line of credit from the federal government, is in financial straits itself. But what it does have is infrastructure, with a post office in most ZIP codes, and a relationship with residents in every kind of neighborhood, from richest to poorest. Last week, the office of the U.S.P.S. inspector general released a white paper noting the “huge market” represented by the population that is underserved by traditional banks, and proposing that the post office get into the business of providing financial services to “those whose needs are not being met.” (I wrote a paper years ago suggesting just such an idea.) Postal banking has a powerful advocate in Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has publicly supported the plan. The U.S.P.S. — which already handles money orders for customers — envisions offering reloadable prepaid debit cards, mobile transactions, domestic and international money transfers, a Bitcoin exchange, and most significantly, small loans. It could offer credit at lower rates than fringe lenders do by taking advantage of economies of scale. The post office has branches in many low-income neighborhoods that have long been deserted by commercial banks. And people at every level of society have a certain familiarity and comfort in the post office that they do not have in more formal banking institutions — a problem that, as a 2011 study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation demonstrated, can keep the poor from using even the banks that are willing to offer them services. Many will oppose the idea of a governmental agency providing financial services. Camden R. Fine, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, has already called the post office proposal “the worst idea since the Ford Edsel.” But the federal government already provides interest-free “financial services” to the largest banks (not to mention the recent bailout funds). And this is done under an implicit social contract: The state supports and insures the banking system, and in return, banks are to provide the general population with access to credit, loans and savings. But in reality, too many are left out. It wasn’t always this way. In 1910, President William Howard Taft established the government-backed postal savings system for recent immigrants and the poor. It lasted until 1967. The government also supported and insured credit unions and savings-and-loans specifically created to provide credit to low-income earners. But by the 1990s, there were essentially two forms of banking: regulated and insured mainstream banks to serve the needs of the wealthy and middle class, and a Wild West of unregulated payday lenders and check-cashing joints that answer the needs of the poor — at a price. People need credit to increase their financial prospects — that’s the theory behind government backing of student loans and mortgages. The Latin root of the word “credit” is credere — to believe. But belief is something that mainstream lenders lack when it comes to assessing the creditworthiness of the poor. And yet establishing credit not only allows individual families and communities to grow wealth, but also allows our economy to do so. Everyone benefits. There is, of course, a certain irony in the post office, cash-strapped and maxed out on credit, looking to elbow in on the business of check-cashing and payday-loan storefronts. And while the U.S.P.S. white paper stresses that its own offerings, rates and fees would be “more affordable,” a note of alarm is raised when it highlights the potential bonanza that providing financial services to the financially underserved could yield, stating that the result could be “major new revenue for the Postal Service” estimated at $8.9 billion a year. It’s a plan that could indeed save the post office, which last year recorded a $1 billion operating loss. In this potential transaction between an institution and a population that are both in need, it would be wise to look back a century ago, at the last time a similar experiment was conducted. In 1913, the chief post office inspector, Carter Keene, declared that the postal savings system was not meant to yield a profit: “Its aim is infinitely higher and more important. Its mission is to encourage thrift and economy among all classes of citizens.” Any benefit to the post office’s bottom line should not come at the expense of those who can least afford it.",1091,680,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/opinion/the-post-office-banks-on-the-poor.html,2014-02-08,The Post Office Banks on the Poor
0,joe,nocera,59,article,"Why in the world did Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, let Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina out of prison? It was hard not to wonder about that this week as the two formerly imprisoned members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot made their whirlwind tour of New York: appearing on “The Colbert Report”; dropping in on Samantha Power, the United Nations ambassador; being introduced by Madonna at a huge Amnesty International rock concert at Barclays Center — and, midmorning on Wednesday, visiting The New York Times’s editorial board. Pussy Riot became famous, of course, in February 2012, when five of its members, wearing masks, took to the altar of Moscow’s main Russian Orthodox church to sing an anti-Putin song. Three of them were soon apprehended and charged with “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred.” Nadezhda and Maria were sentenced to two years in prison. (The third member of the band to be charged was given a suspended sentence.) Then, in late December, with two months remaining on their sentences, the government released them under an amnesty law that seemed plainly aimed at quieting criticism in the run-up to the Sochi Olympics of Russia’s treatment of political prisoners. Or at least those political prisoners well known in the West. Just a few days earlier, for instance, Mikhail Khodorkovsky had been freed by Putin after more than 10 years in prison. During that time, Khodorkovsky had become an eloquent spokesman for those who opposed Putin’s crackdown on dissent and freedom. But he had also once been Russia’s richest man, and he had undoubtedly done some unsavory things in putting together his business empire years earlier. Even though the charges against him were bogus, there were people, and not just in Russia, who thought he was only getting what was coming to him. But Pussy Riot? You couldn’t ask for more appealing activists. Not only had their prosecution been unjust, but they were young and attractive and intelligent and fearless. After they were released, Amnesty International invited them to New York and set about making sure their voices were heard by as wide an audience as possible. If Putin’s plan was, in fact, to quiet criticism during the Winter Olympics, it backfired spectacularly. The conference room on the 13th floor of The New York Times building was standing-room only for Maria, 25, and Nadezhda, 24. We asked the obvious question: Are they worried that Putin would put them in prison again? No, said Maria. “In the two years since we were imprisoned, the situation in Russia has gotten so much worse,” she said. “And if we couldn’t keep quiet about it then, we certainly won’t keep quiet about it now.” It was understandable that so many people in Russia were afraid to speak out, they said. Maria noted that many institutions in Russia were based on “a conveyor principle, which stamps out identical things, and that’s what they’re trying to do to people, too.” Nadezhda added that when the whole country sees completely innocent people being jailed, “then, of course, it is going to make a lot of people become more silent.” It was their firm belief that Western support mattered. Just knowing there were people calling for their release helped sustain them when they were in prison — and, they were convinced, ultimately helped bring about their release. “The lesson that we learned from this is that Putin is concerned with the opinions of the Western press,” said Nadezhda. She urged the West to push for the release of less-well-known prisoners “who perhaps deserve to be freed even more than we did.” She mentioned especially those who had been arrested on May 6, 2012, while protesting “the rigged elections right before the inauguration” of Putin. They had been in prison ever since. Their sentencing is set for Feb. 21 — conveniently after the Olympics. Eventually, the talk got around to what it was like to be in a Russian prison. “We were constantly watched,” said Maria; in Russia, she added, “the more they watch you, the harder your life is.” Nadezhda said that in some prison colonies, prisoners worked 16 to 20 hours a day. For punishment, prisoners were sometimes locked outdoors, even in the cold and the rain, for eight hours at a stretch. Yet despite the miserable conditions, Nadezhda described their time in prison as “a very important and educational experience,” and said that they were “going to apply the lessons we learned in our future work.” They plan to push for prison reform when they return to Russia; one of the places they planned to visit while in New York was Rikers Island. By the end of the meeting, I wasn’t wondering anymore why Putin let them out of prison. The more powerful question was what kind of government would put people like Maria and Nadezhda in prison in the first place?",150,189,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/opinion/nocera-pussy-riot-tells-all.html,2014-02-08,Pussy Riot Tells All
0,strobe,talbott,7,article,"WASHINGTON — Money is an instrument of governance as well as commerce. In almost all countries on earth, the change in people’s pockets and the bank notes in their wallets are an assertion of national sovereignty. Today, there is an exception: the euro, the common currency of 18 of the member states of the European Union. The euro zone puts these countries in the vanguard of the greatest experiment in regional cooperation the world has ever known. Yet that venture has had a rough five years. In the wake of the Great Recession, the euro has become economically disruptive and politically divisive, pitting the states of northern and southern Europe against one another. The crisis is not over, but Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President François Hollande of France and their fellow leaders are determined to keep the euro zone intact. They are reinforcing accords on national budgets, spending and financial regulation, pushing ahead with a banking union, and tackling unemployment. These measures are necessary to salvage economic integration and serve its original purpose: to bind up the wounds of the most bloodstained continent in modern history and turn it into a zone of peace, prosperity and democracy, governed by common policies and administrative structures. That is the European Project. Its master architect, Jean Monnet — even though he died nearly 35 years ago — would have understood the mistakes, dilemmas and dangers that threaten that project now. It is likely he would also have supported the remedies that European leaders are attempting, since they fit with his conviction that political institution-building and economic integration had to be carefully synchronized. Monnet has been hailed as a statesman. In fact, he was something far rarer and more consequential — a key figure in the transformation of the concept of statehood itself. He never held elective office or a ministerial post, but he was an effective advocate. Modernization, this Frenchman believed, was more than the exploitation of new technologies to improve industry, transportation and communication; it also meant adjusting to the ways in which individual nations were conjoined by an ever thickening skein of economic transactions. Monnet quit school when he was 16 to enter the family brandy business. The experience taught him to respect consistency of method and the importance of proper sequence in a complex process: hanging the vines on meticulously laid-out trellises, fermenting the juices of the grapes for weeks, distilling them twice, then storing the final product in neatly arrayed oak casks in dark cellars for anywhere from two years to five decades or more. As a salesman of this patiently produced and precious commodity, he absorbed the basics of finance and commerce. The House of Monnet was competing against Cognac’s superpowers, Hennessy and Martell. But brandy merchants also depended on cooperation to broaden the global market for the benefit of all. An environment conducive to vigorous trade was a common good. That was an ethos that suited Monnet’s temperament. At the end of his long life, Monnet described his birthplace as a brandy town where “one did one thing, slowly and with concentration.” That could have served as a motto for his life: the cultivation and marketing of a grand plan to bring lasting peace to Europe. Like the liberal economist John Maynard Keynes, Monnet came to view the “war guilt” clause in the Versailles Treaty, which concluded the First World War, as a mistake. It enforced a Carthaginian peace on Germany, demanding reparations in the form of payments and transfers of property, and sowed the seeds of the next conflict. Even in the dark days of the late 1930s and early ’40s, however, when the Axis dominated most of the Continent, Monnet was thinking ahead about how to break the cycle of total war followed by a false peace. At a meeting of the French government-in-exile in Algiers in 1943, he declared, “There will be no peace in Europe if the states are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty ... The countries of Europe are too small to guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development. The European states must constitute themselves into a federation.” Two years later, after Germany and its allies surrendered, Monnet had his chance to begin realizing his vision. As commissioner-general of the French National Planning Board, Monnet advised Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the president of the provisional government at the end of the war, on the reconstruction of the French economy. One obvious means was to tap into Germany’s industrial potential, much of which was still intact. The Monnet Plan, as it became known, proposed the expropriation of coal from German mines in the Ruhr and Saar regions to fire the furnaces of French steel factories. In addition to hastening the recovery of France, this inhibited Germany’s ability to rearm. Therein lies an irony: the Monnet Plan had an unmistakable aspect of Versailles redux. If its punitive measures had remained in place, it would have crippled Germany’s recovery, and very likely — as Versailles had done — sown dragons’ teeth in the soil of Europe. Over the next four years, Monnet worked on a successor arrangement that was negotiated with Germany, not imposed on it. The agreement lowered duties and restrictions on coal and steel trade between France and Germany, bringing two vital sectors together under the aegis of a joint state-sponsored authority. This bilateral accord was an exemplar of Monnet’s strategy for diluting national sovereignties by creating new economic facts on the ground, which, in time, would lead political leaders to see the virtue in acting on the Pan-European level. The 1951 Treaty of Paris was a step in that direction: It added Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to what became the European Coal and Steel Community. The E.C.S.C. was the progenitor of the European Union, based on Monnet’s guiding principle: “Nothing is possible without men, but nothing lasts without institutions.” In 1955, Monnet resigned from the presidency of the E.C.S.C.’s High Authority to found an independent group advocating an all-inclusive European federation. Widely referred to as the Monnet Committee, its formal name was the Action Committee for the United States of Europe. De Gaulle and others sometimes mocked Monnet as “the great American.” He did not much mind, since he admired what he had seen of the United States’ federal democracy. Jean Monnet died, at 90, in March 1979. It was a seminal year in the evolution of Europe. That month, the European Economic Community created the European Currency Unit, the precursor to the euro. The ECU (an acronym pronounced “écu”) was legal tender, but not in the form of paper currency and coins that could be used to buy a croissant. Rather, it was a single-denomination bookkeeping artifice, backed by a portfolio of currencies whose exchange rates were stabilized by an imposed limit on how much they could fluctuate. Together, these devices made it easier to conduct international financial transactions. They constituted the kind of careful, deliberate, steady-as-you-go approach Monnet favored. Three months later, citizens of the nine member states of the E.E.C. went to the polls for history’s first truly international parliamentary election. The European Parliament, based in Strasbourg, France, was initially a consultative body that offered nonbinding opinions on proposals from the European Commission, the executive branch of what was then called the European Community. Europe was laying the foundation for a common monetary system and a representative legislature — two prerequisites for the federalized Europe that Monnet hoped would eventually evolve. But in each case, progress toward that ultimate goal was counterbalanced — and, to a degree, inhibited — by the still powerful instinct to protect the sovereignty of the nation state. And in the realm of fiscal policy, there was no proto-European finance ministry — an institution of the sort that Monnet believed was crucial to successful integration. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 gave the European Community, which by then had 12 members, a new name, the European Union. It also added to the common market and parliament two new “pillars”: a coordinated foreign policy (a proto-ministry of foreign affairs) and judicial cooperation (a proto-ministry of justice). On New Year’s Day 1999, the process of introducing the single currency began. The European Union’s leaders felt that moving forward with the euro would act as an incentive to grant the European Central Bank, established in 1998, more authority over monetary policy. It was often said that the monetary union would be a locomotive that would pull Europe toward an ever more perfect political union. Exactly three years later, euro bank notes and coins began to replace Deutsche marks, francs, lire, pesetas, drachmas and other currencies of the 11 member states that accepted the new currency. (Britain and Denmark negotiated formal opt-outs, and Sweden, through a series of parliamentary maneuvers, has so far avoided joining.) The euro zone thrived as long as its southern tier — despite gargantuan public deficits in countries like Greece and real-estate bubbles in Spain and elsewhere — was buoyed by a rising tide of global growth and a huge influx of German capital. The leaders recognized that a common currency without fiscal coordination could backfire if the European economy went into a tailspin and bubbles started to burst. They enacted a Stability and Growth Pact in the late 1990s to ensure that all members of the euro zone were committed to limiting budget deficits. But the pact was never fully enforced. Nor was there any sense of urgency about bolstering the E.C.B. Good times continued to roll, reinforcing the illusion that there was no need to prepare for a major downturn. There is no doubt about how Monnet would have reacted to the financial upheaval on Wall Street in 2008. Unapologetic Americophile that he was, he was also a believer in sound, transparent business practices. He would have had a tart thing or two to say about the complex, opaque financial schemes that — abetted by the shortcomings of government regulation — toppled major financial institutions, impoverished clients, wreaked havoc on the economy at large and sent a tsunami across the Atlantic. Because Maastricht had failed to give the E.C.B. regulatory powers to address sudden and crippling pressure on the banking system, there were few mechanisms to stanch the spreading damage. In the depths of the crisis, in 2011 and 2012, serious figures on both sides of the Atlantic urged a wholesale, or at least partial, disbanding of the euro zone. The prevailing view, however, was that the euro zone would have to hang together. Expulsions and defections were out of the question. It would do no good to lament the introduction of the euro. Hasty as that decision was, the name of the game now must be stabilizing and strengthening monetary union; to give up on it would be to give up on union itself. Europe still lacks the type of transnational finance ministry Monnet would have advocated, but it is developing some of the functions of one through existing institutions. In particular, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, are empowered to require, monitor and enforce the fiscal responsibility of national governments. In 2011, the E.C.B. reduced its buying of Italian bonds. This led to the fracture of Silvio Berlusconi’s coalition, forcing the transcendently irresponsible prime minister out of office. The ability of the central bank to, in effect, fire a sitting head of government rebuts the gripe that the European Union is hobbled by a lack of clout.
